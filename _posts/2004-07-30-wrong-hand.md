As you <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/142-Console-game-Videos.html">may know</a> I really like watching speedruns of video games. And yesterday, when watching the <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/nesvideos/movies.cgi?id=146">updated Super Metroid movie</a>, I came across this picture in the intro.
</p>
<p>Have you noticed? Samus is actually giving her <em>left</em> hand to this scientist. I needed quite some time to understand that this was not an error of the artist, but actually just another of those well layed out details: The right arm of Samus' suit is equipped with her beam weapon, so she obviously can't use it to shake hands ;-)</p>
<p>And this leads to other conclusions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Her weapon seems hardwired. Else she would have laid it down before delivering the captured Metroid</li>
  <li>She is right-handed. Because in her missions the beam weapon is quite necessary for her sruvival, she would not want to have it attached to the weaker hand</li>
  <li>It must be quite difficult to take off this suit. This has the same reason as my first conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>It's funny to see how much those designers seem to have though about all those details - either consciously or not.</p>
