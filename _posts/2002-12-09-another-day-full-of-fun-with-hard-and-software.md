I was very happy this morning when I've seen that my <a href="http://www.acer.ch/vi/page0.jsp-page79,,,16,,,116,,,,,,,,,1516,,,,,,,,,,,116,16,,16,16,,,,16,,,,16,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,,16,,,0,0,16,,2051291666.htm">Bluetooth-USB-Adaptor</a> (link points to a german page, but I could not find the product on the english pages) finally arrived. It took me about 3 months to actually get one.

I ordered the part to backup and synchronize my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,137,00.html">Nokia 7650</a> with my Desktop PC as I've not seen a way to get the data from my Notebook (where I can use Infrared for synchronmisation) to my Desktop in a simple, automated way, not involving writing a program for myself. And the additional benefit was that BT is a lot faster than the old IR-Connection.

I began installing the adaptor at the same time as Richard did. The difference: He had an Ericsson T68i and - that's my point - a PowerMac with OS 10.2.

The sad stroy: Getting the Nokia PC Suite to work involved hacking the 3Com driver to get it to install with my Acer BT-Card, rebooting about 500 times. And - after many *hours* of trail and error - the results were not satisfying at all: I can synchronize with my Outlook (the good thing), but I cannot do anyting else, Richard can with his mac (where the installation took about 2 minutes): Sending and receiving SMS, making calls, receiving calls,...

I really am thinking about byuing myself a Mac...
