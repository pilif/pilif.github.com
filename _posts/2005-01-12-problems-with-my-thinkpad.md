<p>My <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/166-IBM-Thinkpad-42.html">Thinkpad T42</a> went down <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/183-Unforeseen-annoyance.html">again</a>.</p>
<p>It's the graphics chip again: As soon as I push the device just a little bit, the screen goes blank or becomes garbled.</p>
<p>I hate such things. What's become of IBM lately?</p>
