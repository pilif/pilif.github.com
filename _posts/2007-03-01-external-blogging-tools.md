<p>Ever since I started blogging, I have been using different tools to help me do my thing.</p>
<p>At first, I was using the browser to directly write the articles in the MT interface, but after losing a significant amount of text that way, I quickly migrated to writing my entries in a text editor (<a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a> <a href="/archives/3-Why-I-like-jEdit.html">back then</a>) and pasting them into the MT interface.</p>
<p>Then I learned about the XML-RPC interface to MT and began using <a href="http://www.wbloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a> to do my writing, but stagnation and little quirks made me to back to a real text editor which is what I was using for a long time (though I migrated from MT to s9y in between).</p>
<p>Last year, I caught the buzz about <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a>, which was kind of nice, but generally, I need more freedom in writing HTML than what a WYSIWYG editor can provide me with - especially as I have my special CSS rules for code for example that I prefer to just manually setting the font.</p>
<p>So I was back to the text editor (which went from jEdit to <a href="http://www.textmate.com">TextMate</a> in between).</p>
<p>And then I noticed the blogging bundle.</p>
<p>The blogging bundle for TextMate allows me to keep writing my blog entries in the tool of choice, while being able to post the finished entries direct from within TextMate.</p>
<p>Basically, you configure some basic settings for your blogs and then you write a colon-separated list of values at the beginning of the document which TextMate uses to post your entry.</p>
<p>It can fetch categories, configure pings and comments, set tags - whatever you want. Directly from your editor where you are doing your writing. Of course you can also fetch older postings and edit them.</p>
<p>So this provides me with the best of both worlds: Direct posting to the blog with one key press (Ctrl-Command-P) while writing in the editor of my choice that is very stable and provides me with the maximum flexibility at laying out my articles.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
