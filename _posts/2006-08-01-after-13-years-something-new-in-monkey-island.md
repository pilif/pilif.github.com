It has been 14 years ago that I played Monkey Island for the first time. Well... maybe 13. I just don't remember exactly if it was 1992 or 1993 when my parents finally bought a computer and I illegally copied the game from a classmate (including a photocopied version of that "copy protection" wheel).

Of course it didn't take me 13 years to complete it. But the game was so incredibly cool that I played through it over and over again. And with the downfall of DOS came the advent of <a href="http://www.scummvm.org">ScummVM</a>, allowing me to still play the game.

And just now I started another run - probably because I've seen Pirates of the Carribean 2 last monday and I noticed quite some similarities to Monkey Island - especially the second part (Voodoo Lady in a swamp comes to mind)

Anyways. Today was the first time ever I've seen the scene I screenshotted there.

In all my previous runs, I always "salvaged" the idol as my last task which mean that as soon as I got out of the water, I've seen the ghost ship fade away with Elaine on it.

Now, I did it first as it actually makes sense as that task requires the least amount of walking around, which led me to see this cute scene between Guybrush and Elaine (and not to mention her stupid excuse for not kissing shortly afterwards.

How nice to find something new after 13 long years.
