<p>ok. actually it's not completely different from what I've seen <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/70-The-anatomy-of-a-delphi-crash.html">here</a>, but its quite remarkable that a single error message can fall into two categories at once:</p>

<ul>
 <li>It's a non-average delphi-crash (never seen <b>that</b> before)
 <li>It's completly un-understandable and says nothing about the problem.
</ul>
<p>Very nice...</p>
