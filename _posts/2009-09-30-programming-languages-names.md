Today in the office, a discussion about the merits of Ruby compared to Python and the other way around (isn't it fun to have people around actually willing to discuss such issues?) lead into us making fun of different programming languages by interjecting some sore points about them into their names.

The Skype conversation went roughly as follows (I removed some stuff for brevity but all the language names are intact):

<blockquote><strong>thepilif</strong>: <em>ja-long variable names and no function pointers-va really sucks</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: though there's always <em>C(*^~**&lt;&lt;)++</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: and then there's alyways <em>Del-Access violation at address 02E41C10. Read of address 02E41C10-phi</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: or <em>P-false==true-HP</em>
<strong>Coworker</strong>: ok so for the sake of it i should add <em>py    thon</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: or <em>java-everything is global-script</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: too bad it doesn't work for C
<strong>thepilif</strong>: <em>C-sigsegv</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: they know why they just chose one letter
<strong>Coworker</strong>: exactly, k&amp;r are smart
<strong>Coworker</strong>: <em>has-how the fuck do i do a print-skell</em>?
<strong>Coworker</strong>: <em>pe/(^$^)/rl</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: or <em>pe-module? object? hash? what's the difference-rl</em>
<strong>Coworker</strong>: so we could say <em>pe/$^/rl</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: and <em>ru-lets rewrite our syntax on the fly-by</em>
<strong>Coworker</strong>: <em>l(i(s(p)))</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: can't you wrap this into another pair of ()?
<strong>thepilif</strong>: <em>(l(i(s(p))))))</em>
<strong>Coworker</strong>: yes even better
<strong>thepilif</strong>: and add the syntax error
<strong>thepilif</strong>: one too many )
<strong>Coworker</strong>: it's impossible to match them just by looking
<strong>thepilif</strong>: totally impossible. yes
<strong>Coworker</strong>: <strong>the human brain is no fucking pushdown automata</strong>
<strong>Coworker</strong>: but maybe the lisp people are
<strong>Coworker</strong>: vb! vb needs one
<strong>thepilif</strong>: <em>visual-on error resume next-basic</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: and of course <em>brain-&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;******&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-fuck</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: <em>c-tries to be dynamic, but var just doesn't cut it-#</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: <em>c-not quite java nor c(++)?-#</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: though the first one feels better
<strong>thepilif</strong>: oh.. and of course <em>HT-unknown error-ML</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: as a tribute to IE6
<strong>thepilif</strong>: and of course <em>la-no bugs but still not usable-tex</em>
<strong>thepilif</strong>: sorry, Knuth
<strong>thepilif</strong>: and <em>send-$*$_**^$$$-mail</em></blockquote>

So the question is: Do you have anything to add? Do you feel that we were overly unfair?
