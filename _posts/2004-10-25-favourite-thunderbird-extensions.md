<p><a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/173-My-favourite-Firefox-extensions.html">last time</a> I talked about my favourite extensions to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> and while this list is outdated already (I've got some more on the list), I think it's time for the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> list:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/download.html">Enigmail</a> is the all-you-need solution for encryption matters. Unfortunately, not many of my common adressees have GPG-keys already, but maybe that's going to change. Important emails I'm sending out are signed.</li>
 <li><a href="http://quotecolors.mozdev.org/">QuoteColors</a> is a must-have for me as only with this extension Thunderbird complies to point 7 on <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/34-Mail-for-Windows-as-I-like-it.html">my list</a> of features I want in a mail client.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.brunschwig.net/ClearSearch/">ClearSearch</a>  re-adds the Clear-button to the search toolbar. It's quite click-intensive to clear the filter without this button and it even serves as another indicator of whether a filter ist active or not (it's disabled, if not).</li>
</ul>
<p>So: Not many Extensions, but absolutely important to me. I wonder: What are others using? The same? More? Different?</p>
