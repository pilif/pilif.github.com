<p>When your fuse box looks like the one on this photo and when your bedroom wall looks <a href="http://www.lipfi.ch/gallery2/v/flat/renovation/IMG_0014.JPG.html">like this</a> then you can be sure of one thing: You don't have power.</p>
<p>What's more interesting though is that for one time in my whole life, Cablecom did something right: Three months ago, I had them move my cable internet access from my old address to the new one by November, 15th</p>
<p>The problem is that you have to do this three months in advance and back then, I wasn't sure how long the renovation of my bathroom was going to take. So I guessed.</p>
<p>Of course that guess turned out to be wrong: The bathroom, while making splendid progress, is still two weeks off from being completed.</p>
<p>But there was no way to explain that to Cablecom.</p>
<p>They successfully switched over my internet connection from my current flat to the new one where I don't have my stuff, some essential parts of my furniture (like my bed), and even worse: No power, no water, no toilet (that is currently lying on the balcony waiting for the bathroom to be completed before they can replug it).</p>
<p>So for now, Internet is something I can only have at work.</p>
<p>The irony is that usually, Cablecom screws everything up you may want from them. Their internet access is flawless and always working, but whenever you have <em>any</em> administrative request, you can be sure that they screw up.</p>
<p>To underline this, I have two nice conversations with them:</p>
<div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 3px">
<p>
<b>Me:</b> Why do I not get any bills from you? As much as I like not paying for your service, I'd hate you turning it off because I'm not paying for it. Please start sending me bills!
</p>
<p><b>Them:</b> What's your customer ID?</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> No Idea. But my name is Philip Hofstetter and I live at ...</p>
<p><b>Them:</b> Let me check...</p>
<p><b>Them:</b> Are you sure that you are our customer? I can't find you here...</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> Totally sure. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Them:</b> That just can't be.</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> And yet it is: As a matter of fact, I'm currently using the phone you have sent to me calling over your connection you provide me with and I'd really like to pay for.</p>
<p><b>Them:</b> Sure?</p>
</div>
<p>That episode ended with me getting one hell of an envelope containing about 20 bills. I'm sure that had I not called, I would have been able to surf and phone for free, but I didn't want to take the risk of ending up with no internet and no way of getting it back. Besides, not paying for a service used is unfair for both the provider and the other people who are forced to pay.</p>
<p>The other episode was shorter and happened to Ebi, a friend of mine:</p>
<div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 3px">
<p><b>Ebi:</b> Hello, I have a question: What is my customer ID? My Name is xxx and I live in xxx</p>
<p><b>Them:</b> No problem. Can I first have your customer ID though?</p>
</div>
<p>Other episodes turn around redundant modems being delivered, about accounts where multiple bills are sent for the same service, about not being able to fix an obvious defect at the in-house repeater or, a CHF 100'000+ water damage caused by them not sealing a pipe properly (their insurance payed for that of course).</p>
<p>Still: Their internet service is kick-ass! No downtime. Maximum speeds. No forced disconnection. No forced reverse proxy or other crap.</p>
<p>That's why I prefer them to any ADSL provider out there.</p>
<p>It's just ironic that a company this prone to screwing up administrative tasks actually does the right thing that one time where some delay would not have mattered - or would even have been preferred.</p>
<p>Well... at least I have one more reason to be looking forward to december now.</p>
