<p>While everyone keeps calling her Marle, she is actually the princess Nadia of the Kingdom of Guardia in what many people are calling the best console RPG ever made, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a></p>
<p>Chrono Trigger was one of the last RPGs Squaresoft ever did for the SNES and it's special in many ways: Excellent Music (by <a href="http://www.procyon-studio.com/">Yasunori Mitsuda</a>), excellent graphics, smooth game play, really nice story and: Excellently done characters.</p>
<p>Robo, Frog, Lucca, Marle, Crono, Magus and Ayla - every one of them has its very own style and story. Aside from Crono which is quite the ordinary guy, every one of them is special in its own kind.</p>
<p>The server marle is special on its own way too.</p>
<p>It's not as outstanding as <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/291-Computers-under-my-command-Issue-1-shion.html">shion</a>, but it's special in its own way: It was the first 64Bit machine running a 64Bit OS I've ever deployed.</p>
<p>The OS was <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo linux</a> (as usual) and the machine itself is some IBM xSeries machine equipped with a 3Ghz Xeon processor and 2GB of RAM, so basically nothing you need 64 Bit for.</p>
<p>It still was an interesting experiment to get the machine to work with a 64 Bit OS, though all that went completely uneventful.</p>
<p>Ever since deployed, marle is running at a customers site without crashes or other problems.</p>

marle ~ # uptime
     11:56:13 up 265 days, 44 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.00
</pre>
<p>Not much happening there currently I guess. Also, it's amazing how quickly time passes - installing that machine feels like it was only yesterday.</p>
