<p>For the first time in a very long time, I'm able to use a completely de-table-ized design in pure XHTML and CSS for creating a little web-application in PHP.</p>
<p>While many people just quote less bandwidth usage and better maintainable HTML-Code as the big advantages of using pure CSS layouts, let me add another one: Extremely increased productivity for programmers bringing interactivity to the layout</p>
<p>It's a real pleasure: Never was it so easy to just concentrate on the functionality. No layout-information creeping into the business logic because it's the only way to get some stupid placeholder GIF into the layout. No more error-prone stitching together immense and complicated HTML-snippets. No more debugging what went wrong when building one of those complicated layout tables.</p>
<p>And of course: No more pulling out hears when having a look at the size of the generated HTML-Code</p>
<p>I've never been as productive in coding a web application than in this case where the HTML-code is clean and the design is where it belongs to: In the CSS (which I don't have to touch (anymore - the whole thing happens to be written by myself - Richard isn't that good in CSS yet))</p>
<p>If only all future projects would be CSS-only. It would make live so much easier...</p>
