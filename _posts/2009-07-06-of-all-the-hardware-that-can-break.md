... it has to be the one that's most difficult to replace.

Today, my <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/2006/09/upgrading-the-home-entertainment-system/">Gefen HDMI over Cat5 adapter</a> died. Well. It didn't die completely, it just lost its ability to produce a stable image. What is transmitted is very intermittent and in the few seconds the image is available, it's heavily distorted.

Also, it's not the obvious issue (faulty cabling) as the problems did not go away after using two very short (1m) cat 5 cables to test.

Now this is really bad for a variety of reasons:
<ul>
	<li>Only just last Saturday I bought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_The_Last_Hope">Star Ocean</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Vesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a> for my 360, giving me a total play time of 1.5 hours so far.</li>
	<li>Yesterday I noticed that Worms: Armageddon was released for Xbox arcade and I have already invited Ebi after the huge success that was our earlier Worms evening on the 360.</li>
	<li>My setup is totally dependent on the two extenders as I am covering more than 20 meters of distance between receiver and projector. No extender, no Xbox, no Wii, no projector.</li>
	<li>Last time I waited around six weeks for the extender to arrive</li>
</ul>
Of all the hardware I'm having at home, the HDMI extender is the worst to break. Not only is it very hard to replace (see above), it's so deeply integrated into my home cinema setup that just <em>debugging</em> what was going on took a ladder, a screwdriver, a hex-wrench and unwinding an ungodly heap of cables.

All of that in an apartment whose temperature is currently at 30°C (86 °F) and with a hell of a headache.

I'd take anything else going down. Anything but that Gefen extender. My XBox? Sure. Shion? It'd suck, but sure if it has to be, go ahead. My reciever? That would hurt as it was very expensive, but at least it's easily replaced.

Why did it have to be that Gefen extender? Why??
