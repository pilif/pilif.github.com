<p>
While reading <a href="http://www.lwn.net">LWN</a> today, I stopped at the following quote as posted in this weeks <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> Weekly News:
</p>
<blockquote>
While there was some <em>subversive</em> discussion about source control
programs <em>arching</em> through the mailing lists this week, those with an eye on
the CVS repository noticed several interesting changes come down the pike.
</blockquote>
<p>
With the whole war going on about <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/">arch</a> being better, this phrase is just great.
