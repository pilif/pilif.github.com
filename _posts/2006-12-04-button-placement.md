<p>Besides the fact that this message is lying to me (the device in question certainly is a Windows Mobile device and there can't be any cradle problem because it's an emulated image ActiveSync is trying to connect to), I have one question: What exactly do the OK and the Cancel button do?</p>
<p>And this newly created dialog is in ActiveSync 4.2 - way after the MS guys are said to have seen the light and are trying to optimize usability.</p>
<p>Oh and I could list some other "fishy" things about this dialog:</p>
<ul>
 <li>It has no indication of what the real problem is (a soft reset of the emulator image helped, by the way).</li>
 <li>It has way too much text on it</li>
 <li>Trying to format a list using * and improper indentation looks very unprofessional. Judging from the bottom part of the dialog where the buttons are, this is no plain <tt>MessageBox</tt> anyways, so it would have been doable to fix that.</li>
  <li>The spacing between the buttons is not exactly consistend with the Windows-Standard</li>
</ul>
<p>Dialogs like these is precisely why I doubt that Windows Mobile really is the right OS to run on a barcode scanner - at least if it's a scanner that will be distributed among end-users with no clue of PCs. It's such a good thing that the scanners finally have GPRS included.</p>
