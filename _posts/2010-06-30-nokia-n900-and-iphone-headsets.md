For a geek like me, the <a href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/">Nokia N900</a> is paradise on earth: It's full Debian Linux in your bag. It has the best IM integration I have ever seen on any mobile device. It has the best VoIP (Skype, SIP) integration I have ever seen on any mobile device and it has one of the coolest multitasking implementations I've seen on any mobile device (the card-based task/application switching is <em>fantastic</em>).

Unfortunately, there's one thing that prevents me from using it (or many other phones) to replace my iPhone: While the whole world agreed on one way to wire a microphone/headphone combination, Apple thought it wise to do it another way, which leads to Apple compatible headsets not working with the N900.

By not working I don't just mean "no microphone" or even "no sound". No. I mean "deafening buzzing on both the left and right channel and headset still not being recognized in the software".

The problem is that I already own iPhone compatible headsets and that it's way easier to get good iPhone compatible ones around here. I'm <em>constantly</em> listening to audio on my phone (Podcast, Audiobooks). Having to grab the phone out of my bag and unplugging the headphones whenever it rings is inacceptable to me, so I need to have a microphone with my headphones.

Just now though, I found <a href="http://www.kvconnection.com/product-p/km-354r3m-r2f.htm">a small adapter</a> which promises to solve that problem, proving once again, that there's nothing that's not being sold on the internet.

I ordered one (thankfully one of the international shipping options was less than the adapter itself - something I'm not used to with the smaller stores), so we'll see how that goes. If it means that I can use a N900 as my one and only device, I'll be a very happy person indeed.
