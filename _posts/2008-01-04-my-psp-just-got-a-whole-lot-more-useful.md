<a class='serendipity_image_link' href='http://www.gnegg.ch/uploads/update.jpg'><!-- s9ymdb:31 --><img width="170" height="128" style="float: left; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;" src="http://www.gnegg.ch/uploads/update.serendipityThumb.jpg" alt="" /></a><p>Or useful at all - considering the games that are available to that console. To be honest: Of all the consoles I have owned in my life, the PSP must be the most underused one. I basically own two games for it: <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/data/928759.html">Breath of Fire</a> and <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/data/920817.html">Tales of Eternia</a> - not only by this choice of titles, but also by reading this blog, you may notice a certain affinity to Japanese Style RPG's.</p> <p>These are the closest thing to a successor of the classical graphic adventures I started my computer career with, minus hard to solve puzzles plus a much more interesting story (generally). So for my taste, these things are a perfect match.</p> <p>But back to the PSP. It's an old model - one of the first here in Switzerland. One of the first on the world to be honest: I bought the thing WAAAY back with hopes of seeing many interesting RPG's - or even just good ports of old classics. Sadly neither really happened.</p> <p>Then, a couple of days ago, I found a usable copy of the game <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/data/924594.html">Lumines</a>. Usable in a sense of when the guy in the store told me that there is a sequel out and I told him that I did not intend to actually play the game, he just blinked with one eye and wished me good luck with my endeavor. </p> <p>Or in layman's terms: That particular version of Lumines had a security flaw allowing one to do a lot of interesting stuff with the PSP. Like installing an older, flawed version of the firmware which in turn allows to completely bypass whatever security the PSP would provide.</p> <p>And now I'm running the latest M33 firmware: 3.71-M4. </p> <p>What does that mean? It means that the former quite useless device has just become the device of my dreams: It runs SNES games. It runs Playstation 1 games. It's portable. I can use it in bed without a large assembly of cables, gamepads and laptops. It's instant-on. It's optimized for console games. It has a really nice digital directional pad (gone are the days of struggling with diagonally-emphasized joypads - try playing Super Metroid with one of these).</p> <p>It plays games like Xenogears, Chrono Cross, Chrono Trigger - it finally allows me to enjoy the RPG's of old in bed before falling asleep. Or in the bathtub. Or whatever.</p> <p>It's a real shame that once more I had to resort to legally questionable means to get a particular device to a state I imagine it to be. Why can't I buy <em>any</em> PS1 game directly from Sony? Why are the games I want to play not even available in Switzerland? Why is it illegal to play the games I want to play? Why are most of the gadgets sold today crippled in a way or another? Why is it illegal to un-cripple our gadgets we bought?</p> <p>Questions I, frankly, don't want to answer. For years now I wanted a possibility to play Xenogears in bed and while taking a bath. Now I can, so I'm happy. And playing Xenogears. And loving it like when I was playing through that jewel of game history for the first time.</p> <p>If I find time, expect some more in-depth articles about the greatness of Xenogears (just kidding - just read the early articles in this blog) or how to finally get your PSP where you want it to be - there are lots of small things to keep in mind to make it work completely satisfactory.&nbsp; </p>
