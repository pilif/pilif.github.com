<p>Maybe you know it: There's a big community about remixing video games music at <a href="http://www.ocremic.org">ocremix</a>. Additionally, there's an ogg-stream available <a href="http://oc.ormgas.com/ocmain.php">here</a> which is what I'm currently mostly listening to while at work.</p>

<p>There's some techno in there I really dislike, but I usually just close my ears (mentally) then. But mostly it's really great sound - especially if you know the games.</p>

<p>Well... And just some moments ago, I listened to <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00205/">Death on the Snowfield</a> which is a remix of Terra's theme from Final Fantasy VI.</p>

<p>I've always been a big fan of the music in said game - IMHO it's the best thing Noubo Uematsu has done so far. Terra's theme is the best part of a the best composition of the second best video games composer... you could say that it's pretty good ;-)</p>

<p>But what made me write this entry: Said <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00205/">Remix</a> is so beautiful - it made me cry (and listen to it over and over again). I really recommend you to get that mp3 and see if you like it aswell.</p>

<p>So good!</p>
