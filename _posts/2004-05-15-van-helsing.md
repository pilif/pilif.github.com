Van Helsing is maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I have some sort of qualification for movies. The really bad ones are sarcastically called BME (best movie ever) and for Van Helsing we had to create a new category "BME plus" (or BME+)...
</p><p> The silliest thing about the movie are the stupid dialogs. I mean phrases like "I've never been to the sea.... it must be beautiful" - and such a thing completly out of context after being nearly killed by vampires. Really nice.
</p>
<p>The worst thing is the pseudo-romantic ending. I will not lose any more words about that. It's just bad.
</p>
<p>And then there's the soundtrack...</p>
<p>This is quite a different thing: It's just great. When I heard it in the movie I took a mental note to get the CD and today I did. Great! If only it was longer than those 40 minutes...</p>
