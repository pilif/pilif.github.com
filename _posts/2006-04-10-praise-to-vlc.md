<p>Now that I can be assured to have a <a href="/archives/275-XP-on-the-MacBook-Pro.html">windows system ready at hand</a> should I need one, I'm more and more switching over to using Mac OS X for day-to-day productivity work - at least if it's not about doing delphi work.</p>

<p>Now this sounds crazy, but in the end it all boils down to (IMHO) better font rendering and a
alpha-blended terminal.</p>

<p>Functionality-wise and productivity-wise, MacOS and Windows are on par. Both systems have little things that suck and both have advantages in other little things.</p>

<p>In the end, both are OSes.</p>

<p>Today, I was in the position of wanting to listen to the <a href="http://oc.ormgas.com">streaming version</a> of <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/">OCRemixes</a> once again.</p>

<p>They are using an .ogg-stream which I appreciate because of two things: For one it provides a
better Bandwith:Quality ratio and furthermore ogg's a patent-free technology.</p>

<p>Problem: How to listen to a OGG-Stream on OS X?</p>

<p>Apples arrogance in regards of QuickTime is one of those things that bother me in OSX. Apple: There's more to the world of multimedia than just QuickTime and MP3, so make the infrastructure extendable in a sense so it actually works (Hint: DirectShow works quite well - despite being a Microsoft product).</p>

<p>There are some QT/Ogg-plugins available on the net, but none of them (not even one I compiled myself to be 100% sure to have an Intel build) actually worked.</p>

<p>Just when I thought that all was lost, I remembered <a href="http://www.videolan.org">VLC</a>.</p>

<p>My experience with video already showed it to me: VLC just plays everything you can possibly throw at it. And yes: It managed (and still manages) to play the remixes stream.</p>

<p>And the UI is great on OS X (if you don't look at the awful preferences dialog).</p>

<p>VLC IMHO is a really nice example how a cross-platfrom UI should be done: It looks like it's perfectly at home on my OSX. And it ALSO looks like it's perfectly at home on Windows XP (a bit
minimalistic, but it does it's job).</p>

<p>And with feeling at home I don't mean: "It looks the same on both platforms". No. It's perfectly adapting to the look &amp; feel of the platform it's running on. No common theme, no quasi OS-look. It looks as much as your native Mac OS X application as, say, iTunes or TextMate does.</p>

<p>So: Thanks guys. This is great stuff!</p>
