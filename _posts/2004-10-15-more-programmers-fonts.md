<p>In an <a href="http://urbanmainframe.com/folders/blog/20041006/">older post</a> of Urban Mainfraime, I read about some fonts for programmers. Jonathan recommends <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a> and <a href="http://www.december14.net/fonts.shtml">Bitstream Vera Sans Mono</a>.</p>

<p>While both fonts are certainly better than the omnipresent Courier, I still think, <a href="http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/">ProFont</a>, which I've <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/80-Programmers-Font.html">already written about</a> is much better than te other two alternatvies.</p>

<p>ProFont is a Bitmap font, optimized for 8px size, which is incredibly small. Because every character is hand-painted, the font is still very readable desite it's small size, so it's great if you want to have much text on little space - als always when programming ;-)
</p>

<p>Maybe it takes a litte getting-used-to, but every Monospaced font I've seen since I switched to ProFont in Putty, Thunderbird, Delphi, jEdit and all other applications, looks clunky and too large for my eyes. Try it!</p>
