<p>I've just seen this on slashdot today. It seems like we have some opposed oppinions on how to tag <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/16/0112214">this article</a>.</p>
<p>IMHO, it's clearly FUD. FUD does not necessarily have to mean something <b>you</b> may fear. It can also be about something <b>they</b> may fear.</p>
