<p>Today, my hardcopy of <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ajax/index.html">Pragmatic Ajax</a> arrived. I bought the bundle edition consisting of the PDF beta version of the book and the printed edition.</p>
<p>It's a wonderful book. I have been doing AJAX since a bit earlier than the launch of Google Maps, but I still thought that I need some brushing up especially in the matters of usable frameworks (I've been doing everything from scratch) and useful practices.</p>
<p>Considering that I liked every book of the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com">Pragmatic Programmers</a> I've read so far (we share the same mindset I guess), the decision to buy that book was a non-issue.</p>
<p>I've been reading the PDF-edition so far and completed about the first half of it, but I'm very happy now to see the dead-tree edition as reading that is much easier in terms of handling (no cheap printouts and no computer needed to read it).</p>
<p>The first half was very interesting, but I think I'll better write a complete review once I'm through with it.</p>
<p>And in case you wonder what that picture above means... Well... Here in Switzerland, we have a brand of cleaner fluid which is called <a href="http://www.colgate.ch/de/products/householdcare/allpurpose.shtml#">AJAX</a>.</p>
<p>And we have had that for <em>years</em>, so they are not just riding some strange fashion mood like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ristau/111447814/">these guys</a>. I wonder if the inventor of the AJAX acronym knew :-)</p>
