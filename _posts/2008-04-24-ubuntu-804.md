I'm sure that you have heard the news: <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> 8.04 is out.

Congratulations to Canonical and their community for another fine release of a really nice Linux distribution.

What prompted me to write this entry though is the fact that I have updated <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/2006/07/computers-under-my-command-issue-1-shion/">shion</a> from 7.10 to 8.04 this afternoon. Over a SSH connection.

The whole process took about 10 minutes (including the download time) and was completely flawless. Everything kept working as it was before. After the reboot (which also went flawlessly), even OpenVPN came back up and connected to the office so I could have a look at how the update went.

This is very, very impressive. Updates are tricky. Especially considering that it's not one application that's updated, not even one OS. It's a seemingly random collection of various applications with their interdependencies, making it virtually impossible to test each and every configuration.

This shows that with a good foundation, everything is possible - even when you don't have the opportunity to test for each and every case.

Congratulations agin, Ubuntu team!
