<p>You may have heard of <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">Geocaching</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend I found my first cache. It was quite well hidden, but as I knew the territory (it's where I lived from 1993 to 2000), it was not that difficult.</p>
<p>When I first tried to find the cache last sunday, it was already quite dark outside, so I had to give up. Yesterday, I've returned and finally found <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?pf=&guid=da2afe51-d5f5-4b97-90e7-c3dd89d550c4&decrypt=y&log=">Magic Place / Forch-Denkmal</a>
</p>
<p> The picture was taken using my <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=us&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10139&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10139">K700i</a>. I didn't have my camera with me</p>
