<p>My <a href="/2008/07/what-sucks-about-the-touch-diamond/">experiment with the Touch Diamond</a> failed. In the end, too many features didn’t work, writing SMS messages was too painful (and expensive – considering all the incomplete and wrong-addressed messages I sent out) and the actual phone was too slow.</p>  <p>In the true spirit of defying all <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/2008/06/which-phone-for-me/">common sense</a>, when there was a chance to grab an iPhone, I went and got one. </p>  <p>What a relief after the painful days with the Diamond: Responsive UI and actually working phone-features. But what really makes the iPhone shine is the attention to detail that was put into designing the basic UI. These are things you don’t notice and never read about, which are very important none the less.</p>  <p>Let me give a couple examples:</p>  <ul>   <li>Both the Diamond and the iPhone turn off the display while talking on the phone. The idea is to save power and to stop heating your ears even more I guess. But, whenever you remove the phone from your ear and hold it in front of you, say to use the keypad, or to look something up, <em>iPhone turns the screen on again. </em>No need to press a button or even manually unlock.      <br />      <br />Listening to your voice mailbox (which is not needed on the iPhone due to visual voicemail which I’m impressed to see working with Swisscom) on the Diamond is a real pain as the display turns off very quickly and for you to&#160; enter key commands, you have to constantly turn the thing back on using the power switch.</li>    <li>When an alarm or timer goes off on the iPhone while music is playing, it fades the music, pauses it and resumes as soon as you have acknowledged the alarm. Very unintrusive and so useful.</li>    <li>Even with silent mode turned on (I always have my phones on silent), the alarm sounds. You can do that in Windows Mobile too, but you have to keep the phone on non-slient and manually change the ring notification to vibration. As soon as you turn the phone to really silent (to, say, silence a game), the alarm will stop sounding – without warning.     <br />      <br />Sure. In some cases, this might be the intended outcome and in the best case, there should be a setting to override the silent mode on demand (like Sony Ericsson’s newer firmwares do it), but it’s a start.</li>    <li></li> </ul>
