<p><strong>Note:</strong> I've written this yesterday, but I forgot to post it until it was too late...</p>
<p>You may <a href="/archives/some_suburban_railways_i.html">have</a> <a href="/archives/too_bad.html">noticed</a> that I'm quite interested in the new trains, Forchbahn recently purchased. Now hear my sad story of failed attempts to finally ride one of them:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Monday, the 23rd of February was the first date when the new cars would have been used in public transport. <a href="/archives/too_bad.html">This</a> is what happened to that train.</li>
 <li>A week ago, March 22nd was the new date when the train was to be used. This time it went smoothly, but unfortunatly, no one told me.</li>
 <li>Last Thursday, March 25th, I would have had time to finally take the ride (they use it just for one run per day (7:32am from Forch) - about 40 minutes. Afterwards the train is used to teach the drivers how to use it). The wednesday before, I was at my parents and had a look at the new train: Three people where above it and tweaking something. When I went home about four hours later, they still where there and it was already 11pm, so I deceided against going at thursday morning - I didn't think, it would have been fixed until then.</li>
 <li>On Friday I didn't have time</li>
 <li>I wasn't sure whether the train is used during the weekend (considering its current stability I think not), so I did not even try to get up at 6 in the morning</li>
 <li>Today I finally went to Forch. What I've seen was the train leaving the depot halfways, then stopping, turning off all lights and lowering the pantographs. Then I've seen the replacement-train coming out and driving to the track where the new one should have departed from. I asked around whether it would work tomorrow and they told me that "yes, it will - provided they fix the train until then" - let's see what tomorrow brings to me.</li>
</ol>
<p>
On the positive side: This afternoon, I've seen the train in one of the instruction runs down here in the city, so I suppose they fixed it.
</p><p>
I love new stuff!
