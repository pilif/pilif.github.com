When I was looking for a new AV-receiver, I soon found out that my whishes cannot be pleased in common consumer-shops like <a href="http://www.mediamarkt.ch">Media Markt</a>. I found <a href="http://www.sony.ch/view.x?cat=1000077&prod=1008751&loc=de_CH">my device</a> by googling.

Where to get it? Although, I am one of those guys that like to go into a store and just take the stuff with me, this was not possible this time as said receiver is quite uncommon (newly on the market and quite expensive [but sounds very nice]), so buying online was my only way to get it.

Browsing around a bit finally lead to <a href="http://www.dvdupgrades.ch">dvdupgrades.ch</a> which has the most complicated user interface I've ever seen on a website (and runs only on IE as the JavaScript for the menues at the top is somewhat strange), but looked quite ok anyway.

They promised delivery somewhere around February, 10th, but the stuff was here already yesterday. They've worked fast and professional. Very nice.

If you live near switzerland and need exotic AV-stuffm especially modified consoles or DVD-players (region code, macrovision, ... - they even wrote a new firmware for Pioneer Players from scratch), give them a shot!
