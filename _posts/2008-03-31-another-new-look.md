<p>It has been a while since the <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/2006/06/one-day-with-serendipity/">last redesign</a> of gnegg.ch, but is a new look after just a little more than one year of usage really needed?</p>  <p>The point is that I have changed blogging engines yet again. This time it's from Serendipity to <a href="http://wordpress.org">Word Press</a>. </p>  <p>What motivated the change? </p>  <p>Interestingly enough, if you ask me, s9y is clearly the better product than Wordpress. If WordPress is Mac OS, then s9y is Linux: It has more features it's based on cleaner code, it doesn't have any commercial backing at all. So the question remains: Why switch?</p>  <p>Because that OSX/Linux-analogy also works the other way around: s9y is an ugly duckling compared to WP. External tools won't work (well) with s9y due to it not being known well enough. The amount of knobs to tweak is sometimes overwhelming and the available plugins are not nearly as polished as the WP ones.</p>  <p>All these are reasons to make me switch. I've used a <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/2006/06/one-day-with-serendipity/">s9y to wp converter</a>, but some heavy tweaking was needed to make it actually transfer category assignements and tags (the former didn't work, the latter wasn't even implemented). Unfortunately, the changes were too hackish to actually publish them here, but it's quite easily done.</p>  <p>Aside of that, most of the site has survived the switch quite nicely (the permalinks are broken once again though), so let's see how this goes :-)</p>
