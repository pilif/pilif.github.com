First of all: A happy new year to my fellow readers. I was in Paris from december 26th to january 2nd which (at least partially) should explain the lack of updates here.

I've just watched the quciktime stream Steve Job's keynote on this years Macworld in San Francisco. And I mostly like what I saw.

OK. The loooooong introduction of iDVD was quite boring and the presentation of iMovie was quite uninteresing (to me), but the rest was quite cool.

The whole thing began with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/burton/">this little thing</a> which I really like but is much too expensive for what it is. Then a down-stripped version of Final Cut Pro, <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutexpress/">Final Cut Express</a> has been introduced. Not quite interesting for me.

The <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">renewed i*-Applications</a> where also not that interesting to me. One exception: iPhoto seems quite cool to me and I will try it out on Richard's Mac here in the office when it's available. What I really liked: Apart from what "analysts" where saying (and from what slashdot gladly <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/03/01/03/2149209.shtml?tid=107">picked up</a>), the i*-Apps remain free to use.

The new presentation software <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> really looks interesting. Maybe I should give it a shot. If it's just half as annoying as PowerPoint, I will really like it.

I was quite surprised to see the new Webbrowser <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> which was announced just after Keynote. I just went to apple.com and downloaded it. Some points:

<ul>
 <li>It does not support tabs
 <li>There is no shortcut for window-cycling (which will render it useless for Richard)
 <li>It's fast.
 <li>It's reat-looking
 <li>I've no idea why it's in the metal-look
</ul>

I was surprised to learn that Apple did not use the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Gecko-Engine</a> but took KHTML from the <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE Project</a>. This is now the second big project prefering KHTML before Geko (the other one will probably be <a href="http://www.wine.org">Wine</a>). Stefe Jobs produly announced that Apple will give the community back any modifications they made to KHTML. he told that Apple belongs to the nice guys respecting Free Software. But when I think of it, I come to the conclusion, that they really <b>had</b> to give the source back. Actually the even must provide us with the <b>full sourcecode</b> of Safari (which they have not yet done so) because KHTML as the rest of KDE is licensed under the GPL and Safari definitlely is a "dereived work".

I hope to see the sorcecode soon. Mostly because I want to see this browser with Tab-Support.

And then came those <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Powerbooks</a>...

I really like them and one of those will definitely be the first Mac i am going to buy myself. I am not quite sure which of them as both of them have a flaw:

<ul>
 <li>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html">17''-PB</a>is just a little to big to carry around. Additionally  I am asking myself why they did not use the free space to enlarge the keyboard. It seems quite small to me and the wide free space right and left of it looks stupid.
 <li>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html">12''-PB</a> is too small for my likings. I prefer a bigger resolution than 1024x768 (which is very high for a 12'' display).
</ul>

Anyway: The devices are qute cool and I really want to get one.

After all, the Keynote was cool to watch and I am looking forward for the next one.

PS: When downloading Safari, I came across an <a href="http://www.xfree.org">XFree86</a> based <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/">X-Server by Apple</a> but the download-script for collecting Email-Adresses did not work so I could not get it (yet). I wonder: Does this have something to do with FilmGimp? And: Does the clipboard work with this X-Server (it did not with XDarwin)? I'll keep you informed...
