I've read that SonyEricsson today announced another phone, the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/t610/">T610</a>, thich should be the successor of the really cool T68i. The site is not very specific about the size of the device, but it seems to be a bit larger than the T68. It has a built-in camera, bluetooth and all the other thing you like on those advanced phones.

It seems like it uses the same OS, the T68 did (no Symbian), has just 2 MBytes of Memory and comes in various design-flavours. Unfortunatly, the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/t610/specifications/">specifications page</a> is not as detailed as I'd like, but I suspect, the T610 is optimized for not-so-advanced users that like having a phone and not a difficult-to-use PDA.

I've read on <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/04/1354235&mode=nested&tid=137">Slashdot</a> that the T610 will be iSync-compatible from the beginning which worries me a bit as my P800 is not. This does not really matter for me as I am more a PC-guy (but more and more thinking of muying me a Mac just for fun), but it matters for Richard who I'd really like to see buying a P800 too... Possibly, the P800 will never be supported on the Mac, as all the other phones are and there may be no need for Apple to implement another protocol just for one phone. I really hope that's not the case.

Another note: I really think, SonyEricsson is currently doing the right thing: They release quite a lot of devices for quite a broad range of possible users. This combined with the high quality those devices have (Richard recently put his T68i into the water and it's still working...), they really may be able to beat Nokia where tey belong to...
