<a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archives/page_23.php">Asterisk*</a> got me the idea to
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Grab the nearest book.</li>
 <li>Open the book to page 23.</li>
 <li>Find the fifth sentence.</li>
 <li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now the book happens to be <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/swarrior/index.html">Security Warrior</a> by Cyrus Peikari and Anton Chuvakin, O'Reilly. The quote is:
</p>
<blockquote>
Before beginning your practical journey, there is one final issue to note.
</blockquote>
<p>
So: nothing fancy. But the book is great. It reads lika a criminal novel, despite being a tech-book (I don't read much else these days).</p>
