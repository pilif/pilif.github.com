Today while using the right mouse button to open Chrome's context menu to open the web inspector, I followed my Muscle memory to hit the last entry in the context menu.

But instead of the Web Inspector opening, nothing happened for a moment, then I noticed the new Twitter app starting and offering me to send a new tweet.

I quite twitter and watched what was happening.

Twitter has apparently thought that it's important enough to add a "Tweet" menu item to every context menu (of a text selection) on my system. Now I have two questions:
<ol>
	<li>Why is there no way to turn this behavior off?</li>
	<li>Shouldn't apps offered in the new App Store b</li>
</ol>
