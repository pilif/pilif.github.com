Now that I've created the new design for the <a href="index2.htm">front page</a>, the next step was to get working at the archive. As I disliked the Popup-Window, MT created for comments, I had a look into the detail view of an entry, aka. the individual archives.

It's not yet linked from the new index-page, but <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/27-The-13-most-annoying-things-of-the-P800-phone.html">here's an entry</a> using the new template. You may see that I've chosen some more useful filenames for the individual entries, that the sidebar is now also visible in the sub-pages and that the comments still look like they did in the old MT-layout - richard has not provided me with a good looking comments-template yet.

By the way: <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/78-Delphi,-WinXP-and-Password-Edits.html">This</a> would be an entry with trackback-pings. Looks quite nice to me.

If you by any chance visit gnegg.ch, tell my what you think!
