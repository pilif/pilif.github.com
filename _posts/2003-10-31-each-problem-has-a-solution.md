... it's just a question whether you like it or not.

But then again: Does idealism justify using the wrong tool for a particular problem just because the right tool does not seem ideologically right?

We've installed an evaluation version of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange">Microsoft Exchange</a> and despite some problems at first, it's working very well and is the best groupware-solution we have tried so far.

Needless to say that there are many proxies and relays between the net and the actual box. *That* much I don't want to trust it ;-)
