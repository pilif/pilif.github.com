<p>Today I bought myself <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/headservletsjsp/">Head First Servlets &amp; JSP</a>.</p>
<p>While I have absolutely no intention in passing any Java related exam or even do anything JSP-ish in the near future (see my reasons <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/145-PHP-scales-well.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/137-Web-Applications-and-the-View-State.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/58-What-I-dislike-about-Java.html">here</a>), I had to have the book.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>For one thing: While I have my problems with Java, I'm still very interested in it and the technologies around it. This is the reason, why I've already read one or the other book about JSP. The scond reason: The "Head First" series is absolutely the best way of how a tech book can be written. It's a pleasure to read them.</p>
<p>They are that good, that it's even worth reading them even when you don't really need to learn what's in them. It's just fun to read it. Try it yourself!</p>
