My own bookmarks-management is somewhat non-existant. Those few pages I've actually bookmarked are the ones with long URLs (longer than <a href="http://www.lwn.net">lwn.net</a> for example - a page which definitely is one worthy of being in my bookmarks-file). There are so few bookmarks, that I use only the "Personal Toolbar"-Feature of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> - the Bookmarks-Menu is completely empty.

As I wanted to do some coding and tweaking around with MovableType, I've deceided to create <a href="/perstoolbar.php">this little tool</a> which renders my original <tt>bookmarks.html</tt> from my mozilla profile to something more useful.

I initally tried to just apply a CSS-style to the original file, but that was not possible because a) it has much too less named identifiers or structure to style it properly, b) I would have had to do some coding anyway bacause I wanted to display the bookmark-image and c) the original file is nowhere near XHTML-compliant - so that's another reason which would have forced me to do some coding anyway.

I hope you like the thing and forgive me those two "evil" links - there is virtually no way to get to subtitled animees the legal way, so I have to refer to "other" channels. Much the same with english video games: You simply can't get them here in Switzerland, so I usually buy the german version and download the english one (Broken Sword 3 <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/broken_sword_iii.html#000073">was the last one</a>).
