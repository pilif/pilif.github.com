A <a href="http://www.pilif.ch/stuff/pershchg/index.php">tool of mine</a> has been <a href="http://homepages.borland.com/strefethen/index.php?pagename=Main.TipsPage">recognized by Borland</a> (Enabling Windows Search for Delphi related files) - or at least by an <a href="http://homepages.borland.com/strefethen/">employee</a> of them. Now if someone acutally would read those Borland Employee blogs, maybe I could get a little bit of traffic to <a href="http://www.pilif.ch">pilif.ch</a> ;-)
