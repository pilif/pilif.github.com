While experimenting around with <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp">FeedDaemon</a> I came to the conclusion that an XML-Feed containing the whole entry (instead of just the [autogenerated ... I know. I will probably change that sometime] excerpt) would be really nice as it makes FeedDaemon a very useful tool.
</p>
<p>
Other blogs, I'm currently reading (I definitely will update my templates to include links to them) also provide this service.
</p>
<p>
Now I'm not really sure about this whole RSS-Stuff, so I did some copying and pasting from <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/">asterisk*</a> and then validated it using <a href="http://www.feedvalidator.org/">Feed Validator</a> and I quite like the outcome.
</p>
<p>
For now I don't link this new feed with the full postings from every page as it's just a test for me. If you can and have more clue about RSS, try it out: <a href="/index2.rdf">RSS 2.0 Feed with full content</a>
</p>
<p>
In another step, I told MovableType to create the excerpt from 50 instead of 20 words to put a little more value to trackback-pings and the <a href="/index.rdf">old fashioned RDF 1.0 Feed</a>
</p>
<p>Slowly but steady I'm really getting into this blogging-stuff</p>
