it has <a href="/2006/07/nice-summer/">been a while</a> since I've last talked about the weather, but the current official forecast by the <a href="http://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/web/en/weather.html">Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology</a> makes me really, really happy. Especially after a very wet and cold April.

The days of barbecues are back!
