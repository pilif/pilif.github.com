I've just visited the acer-website and downloaded the <a href="ftp://ftp.support.acer-euro.com/wireless/bluetooth/acer/usb-bt500/bt500_1327.exe">driver</a> for my BT500 Bluetooth USB Adaptor. There was no modification date on the website, but a short view on the <a href="ftp://ftp.support.acer-euro.com/wireless/bluetooth/acer/usb-bt500/">FTP-Server</a> revealed that the current release is quite new - from February 19th, actually.

Launching the setup first wanted to remove the current driver (it said, that it was already installed in the newset version and asked whether it should uninstall itself - not quite true - the new software definitly is newer...)

The new Acer-Driver-Release comes with a lot of new assistants, Audio-Profile-Support (a complete new feature for free - I can now use my PC as a headset for my P800) and of course, the way Symbian devices connect to the pc is now fully supported and no more error-messages ar being displayed. Using Bluetooth to synchronize my phone finally makes fun.

Too bad the P800 comes with a USB Base-Station which is faster than BT and is now permanently plugged to my PC ;-) But it was fun to get BT working anyway.
