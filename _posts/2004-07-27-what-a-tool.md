I really like to photograph. I do so since I was a child. Then I bought my Canon ixus 500, which reawakened this old passion of mine. About a week ago or so, I bought O'Reillys <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/digphotohks/">Digital Photography Hacks</a> and read through it, which was quite fun - it's an excellent piece of work. Easy to read while still providing you with quite some knowledge.
</p>
<p>You should defintiely read the book too, if you are interested in digital photography (some hacks apply to the old fashioned analog one too)</p>
<p>
One thing, I noticed when reading through: There is quite a lot of stuff that can't be done using those compact cameras. Many hacks just begin with "if you have feature X, you can..."</p>

<p>The feature list of <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/e1/sys_body_spec.asp">this baby</a> actually contains all those Xes from the book. Wow. That looks nice (besides being written in light-gray on white ;-) ). Expensive, but nice.</p>
