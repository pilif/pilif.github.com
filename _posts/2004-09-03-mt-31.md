<p>As you almost certainly know, <a href="http://www.movabletype.com">MovableType</a> 3.1 has been released.</p>
<p>Reading the feature list - especially the entry about dynamical publishing - I deceided to upgrade.</p>
<p>Needless to say that much went wrong:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The dynamical generation is of no use to me because I'm using (<a href="http://www.nonplus.net/software/mt/MTEntryIfComments.htm">exactly one</a>) cutom tags in my archive template and custom tags do not work with dynamical generation. Too bad. And too much documentatino to read to port it to PHP</li>
 <li>My beautiful mod_perl setup ceased to work. Somehow MT sometimes (this is completely random) gets a random number back from <tt>$q->parse</tt> in lib/MT/App.pm. Updating Perl, Apache and mod_perl did not help. The effect of this bug is a randomly occuring "Upload too large" error. Back to CGI then... (I've opened up a support ticket. Let's see how good this support really is)</li>
</ul>
<p>At least I can now use <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-Blacklist</a> as it does not work in mod_perl. Much trouble for setting up something I dont really like either because of its extremely commercial background. We'll see what the future brings...</p>
