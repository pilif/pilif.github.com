<p>While looking for some documentation for improving my comments-system (later post),  I came across a link to <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/06/announcing_pric.shtml">this blog entry</a> that announces a revised licensing scheme for Movable Type 3.0.</p>
<p>This time they actually did it right: The (still) free edition is now clearly announced. The personal edition is what quite a lot of users (including myself) have wanted (unlimited blogs) and it is quite affordable. This is nice.
</p>
<p>Thank you, Movable Type</p>
