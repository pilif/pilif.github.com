<a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archives/23rd_post.php">asterisk*</a> modified the <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/page_23.html">Page 23</a> idea a bit and came up with this:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>Go into your blog's archives.</li>
   <li>Find your 23rd post (or closest to).</li>
   <li>Find the fifth sentence (or closest to).</li>
   <li>Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Well... my <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/23-Apple-X11-cool.html">23rd post</a> was about Apples X-Server and the fifth sentence (not counting one-word thingies) was:
</p>
<blockquote>
It launches in about half a second on Richard's Mac and launching <a href="http://www.eterm.org/">Eterm</a> or <a href="http://www.nedit.org">nedit</a> just happens instantly without any remarkable delay.
</blockquote> <p>(links added in this quote. I should have made them back then)</p>
