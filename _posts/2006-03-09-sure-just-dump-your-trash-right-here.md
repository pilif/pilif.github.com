<p>Boy was I pissed when I read my mail today:</p>
<div align="center">

<p>Dear Spammer. What do you think to get out of this? All links your post will be masked, so no page rank for you. And I will almost certainly not overlook something like this (400 comments in one night), so no chance in it persisting either.</p>
<p>I'm sick of cleaning up after you guys. Dump your trash somewhere else. /dev/null sounds like a nice alternative.</p>
<p>Oh, and MT: Why did your Spam filter not catch this?</p>
