<p>The Eclipse team seem to have stopped announcing Milestone releases on the front page, so it's a bit tricky to know when a new one is released.</p>
<p>So it may be old news, but Eclipse 3.1 M2 has been released.</p>
<p>It contains some nice <a href="http://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.1M2-200409240800/eclipse-news-M2.html ">new features</a>.
</p>
<p>The Milestone builds are extremely stable, so there should be no problems using it.</p>
