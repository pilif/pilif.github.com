Like a clockwork, about one year after the release of PostgreSQL 8.3, the team behind the best database on this world did it again and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.1108">released PostgreSQL 8.4</a>, the latest and greatest in a long series of awesomeness.

Congratulations to everyone involved and might you have the strength to continue to improve your awesome piece of work.

For me, the hightlights of this new release are
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/app-pgrestore.html">parallel restore</a>: I just tried this out and restoring a dump that usually took around 40 minutes (in standard sql/text format) now takes 5 minutes.</li>
	<li>The improvements to psql usability just make it even clearer that psql isn't just a command line database tool, but that it's one of the best interfaces to access the data and administer the server. psql hands-down beats whatever database GUI tool I have seen so far.</li>
	<li>truncate table reset identity is very useful during development</li>
	<li>no more max_fsm_pages makes maintaining the database even easier and removes one variable to keep track of.</li>
</ul>
Thanks again for yet another awesome release.
