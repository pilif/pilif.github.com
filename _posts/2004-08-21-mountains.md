<p>This is what I'm going to see for the next seven days. Yes. Finally, I will once again travel to a small cottage in Pontresina, enjoy the great landscape and do nothing businessish at all.</p>
<p>So don't expect any postings next week. While I will have extremely limited internet connection (GPRS), I will use it only if <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/110-Speed-up.html">something bad should happen</a>.</p>
