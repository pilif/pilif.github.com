<p>Well. <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/229-World-of-Warcraft.html">Back here</a>, I have begged Blizzard to release a language-pack for WoW, as I had real difficulties playing on an english server with my german version (which I helped later with a semi-legal solution)</p>
<p>Today, they have released language-packs called <a href="http://wow-europe.com/en/info/faq/elp.html">ELP</a> which do exactly what I asked for in my blog entry</p>
<p>Now if the installation would not take that long, I'd happily remove my semi-legal setup and replace it with the original again.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for seeing and solving this problem, Blizzard!</p>
