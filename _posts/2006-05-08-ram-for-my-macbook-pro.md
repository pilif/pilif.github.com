<p>Today, another GB of RAM for my MacBook Pro arrived (I bought it at <a href="http://www.heinigerag.ch">Heiniger AG</a>. It's no original Apple RAM, but it's about a third as expensive as the original).</p>
<p>Installation was <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303491">very easy to do</a> (I link the instructions for the 17" model because that's what I found on the web - it works the same for the 15" model).</p>
<p>And I tell you: This is the best thing to ever happen to a computer of mine performance-wise.</p>
<p>While the system feels a lot snappier in "default mode", it shines even more when I'm running <a href="http://www.parallels.com">Parallels Workstation</a> in the background (at full screen - using <a href="http://virtuedesktops.info/">VirtueDesktop</a>).</p>
<p>I'm inclined to say that the parallels-thing just got usable with this upgrade.</p>
<p>Funny thing: When you are working with Windows XP, you won't notice as much as a speed increase in normal operating mode when you upgrade your RAM from 1GB to 2GB. I guess the memory manager of OSX is just more eager to swap out stuff if RAM gets scarce. And as we all know: Swapping kills a system.</p>
