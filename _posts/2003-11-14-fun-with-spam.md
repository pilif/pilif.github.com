Sometimes, some SPAM slips through my <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssasin</a> filter and is delivered to my mailbox. A real pearl of quality-spam was delivered today. It contained the following paragraph:

<tt>Note that this is not one of the emails that some corrupt Africans do distribute to other countries of the world. You are the only person I am contacting for this transaction and can only contact another person if I found out that you are not ready to be of help. This requires a private arrangement.</TT>

yeah, right!
