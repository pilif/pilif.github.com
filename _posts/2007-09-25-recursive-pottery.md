<p>Yesterday evening, my girlfriend and I had an interesting discussion about pottery techniques. She's studying archeology, so she has a real interest in pottery and techniques used. I in contrast have my interests in different subjects, but this method of potting we came up with was so funny that I thought I just had to post it.</p> <p>Let's say you want to create a vase.</p> <p>Our method involves the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Gather a vase that looks exactly like the one you want to build.  <li>Fill the vase with something that gets hard quickly, but crumples easily.  <li>Wait for that material to dry out, then destroy the original vase.  <li>Put clay around the hardened up filler material.  <li>Wait for the clay to dry up and burn the vase.  <li>Remove the filler material. </li></ol> <p>Obviously this method will never allow you to produce more than one vase as in the process of creating one, you are destroying the other.</p> <p>We continued our discussion of how such a method of pottery could have interesting side effects. One is that the only way for a potter to generate revenue of his work is by <em>renting out</em> his current vase. And should the vase be returned defective, the whole business of the potter is over - until he receives another initial vase to continue working.</p> <p>Of course, getting hold of that would be quite interesting a job if every potter only used this method.</p> <p>And the question remains: Where do you take the initial vase from?</p> <p>Stupid. I know. But fun in its own way. Sometimes, I take great pleasure in inventing something totally stupid and then laugh at it. And believe me: We really had a good laugh about this.</p>
