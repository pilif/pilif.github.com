<p>Usually I'm not here to ask questions, but today I have two for my readers. Maybe someone can help?</p>
<p>It's about <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is there a way to automatically switch back to the Java-perspective after a debugging-session ended?</li>
  <li>Can the complete JDK-Documentation somehow be integrated into the help system? While I know there is Javadoc everywhere while writing code, using the full-text search capabilities of the help-system would be really nice here and then...</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm quite sure, both problems can be solved. I'm just not seeing where. And additionally I've quite some problems devising useful google keywords to find a solution.</p>
<p>So, I thought: Maybe some of my readers know Eclipse better than I do.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated..</p>
