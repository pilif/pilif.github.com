Like <a href="http://blip.tv/jsconfeu/by-philip-hofstetter-node-js-in-production-use-tempalias-com-4258344">back in 2010</a> I went to JSConf.eu this year around.

One of the many impressive facts about JSConf is the quality of their Wifi
connection. It's not just free and stable, it's also fast. Not only that, this
time around, they had a very cool feature: You authenticated via twitter.

As most of the JS community seems to be having twitter accounts anyways, this
was probably the most convenient solution for everyone: You didn't have to
deal with creating an account or asking someone for a password and on the
other hand, the organizers could make sure that, if abuse should happen,
they'd know whom to notify.

On a related note: This was in stark contrast to the WiFi I had in the hotel
which was unstable, slow and cost a ton of money to use and it didn't use
Twitter either :-)

In fact, the twitter thing was so cool to see in practice, that I want to use
it for myself too.

Since the days of WEP-only Nintendo DS, I'm running two WiFi networks at home:
One is WPA protected and for my own use, the other is open, but it runs over
a different interface on <a href="/2006/07/computers-under-my-command-issue-1-shion/">shion</a>
which has no access to any other machine in my network. This is even more
important as <a href="/2005/05/lots-of-fun-with-openvpn/">I have a permanent OpenVPN connection</a>
to my office and I definitely don't want to give the world access to that.

So now the plan would be to change that open network so that it redirects to a
captive portal until the user has authenticated with twitter (I might add
other providers later on - LinkedIn would be *awesome* for the office for
example).

In order for me to actually get the thing going, I'm doing a tempalias on this
one too and keep a diary of my work.

So here we go. I really think that every year I should do some fun-project
that's programming related, can be done on my own and is at least of some use.
<a href="/tags/tempalias/">Last time it was tempalias</a>, this time, it'll be
*Jocotoco* (more about the name in the next installment).

But before we take off, let me give, again, huge thanks to the JSConf crew for
the amazing conference they manage to organize year after year. If I could,
I'd already preorder the tickets for next year :p

Attending a JSConf feels like a two-day drug-trip that lasts for at least two
weeks.
