It seems like I'm not the only one to be reasonable about Gmail. Tim O'Reily even &quot;stole&quot; <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/108-All-this-fuss-about-Gmail.html">my blog's</a> title with <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4707">his article</a>. Nice to find oneself being right in the first place ;-)
