They have just fixed their <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/">download-script</a> for the X-Server. I am downloading now... The archive is 40 Megabytes in size.

What I am keen to see: I have <a href="http://fink.sf.net">Fink</a> and with Fink, XDarwin installed on this machine here.

We'll see, what the Mac-X-Server does to the current X11-installation ;-)
