<p>I haven't been much into podcasts till now: The ones I heard were boring, unprofessional or way too professional. Additionally, I didn't have a nice framework set up to get them and to listen to them.</p>
<p>That's because I don't often sync my ipod. Most of the time, it's not connected to a computer: About once every two months, I connect it to upload a new batch of audiobooks (I can't fit my whole connection on the nano). So podcasting was - even if I had found one that I could interest myself in, an experience to have while behind the computer monitor.</p>
<p>Now two things have changed:</p>
<ol>
 <li>I found the <a href="http://www.linuxactionshow.com/">Linux Action Show</a>. They guy doing that podcast are incredibly talented people. The entries sound very professionally made, while still not being on the obviously commercial side of things. They cover very, very interesting topics and they are everything but boring. Funny, entertaining and competent. Very good stuff.</li>
 <li><p>At least since the release of SlimServer 6.5, my <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com">Squeezebox</a> is able to tune into RSS feeds with enclosures (or podcast for the less technical savy people - not that those would read this blog). Even better: The current server release brought a firmware which finally gives the Squeezebox the capability of natively playing ogg streams.</p><p>Up until now, it could only play FLAC, PCM and MP3, requiring tools like <tt>sox</tt> to convert ogg streams on the fly. Unfortunately, that didn't work as stable as I would have liked, but native OGG support helped <em>a lot</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>So now, whenever a new episode of the podcast is released (once per week - and each episode is nearly two hours in length), I can use my Squeezebox to hear it via my home stereo.</p>
<p>Wow... I'm so looking forward to do that in front of a cozy fire in my fireplace once I can finally move into my new flat.</p>
