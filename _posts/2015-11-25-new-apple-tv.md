When the 2nd generation of the AppleTV came out and offered AirPlay support, I bought one more or less for curiosity value, but it worked so well in conjunction with [AirVideo](http://inmethod.com/airvideohd/index.html) that it has completely replaced my previous attempts at an in-home media center system.

It was silent, never really required OS or application updates, never crashed and never overheated. And thanks to AirVideo it was able to play everthing I could throw at it (at the cost of a server running in the closet of course).

The only inconvenience was the fact that I needed too many devices. Playing a video involved my TV, the AppleTV and my iOS device. Plus remotes for TV and AppleTV. Personally, I didn't really mind much, but while I would have loved to give my parents access to my media library ([1 Gbit/s upstream FTW](/2014/09/geek-heaven/)), the requirement to use three devices and to correctly switch on AirPlay has made this a complete impossibility due to the complexity.

So I patiently awaited the day when the AppleTV would finally be able to run apps itself. There was no technical reason to prevent that - the AppleTV totally was powerful enough for this and it was already running iOS.

You can imagine how happy I was when finally I got what I wanted and the new 4th generation AppleTV was announced. Finally a solution my parents can use. Finally something to help me to ditch the majority of the devices involved.

So of course I bought the new device the moment it became available.

I even had to go through additional trouble due to the lack of the optical digital port (the old AppleTV was connected to a [Sonos playbar](http://www.sonos.com/en-wo/shop/playbar?r=1)), but I found an audio extractor that works well enough.

So now after a few weeks of use, the one thing that actually pushed me to write this post here is the fact that the new AppleTV is probably the most unfinished and unpolished product that I have ever bought from Apple. Does it work? Yes. But the list of small oversights and missing pieces is as big as I have never seen in an Apple product. Ever.

Let me give you a list - quite like [what I've done 12 years ago](/2003/02/the-13-most-annoying-things-of-the-p800-phone/) for a very different device

* While the AppleTV provides you with an option to touch it with an iOS device for the configuration of the Wifi and the appleid settings, I still had to type in my appleid password twice: Once for the AppStore and once for the game center. Mind you, my appleid password is 30 characters long, containing uppercase, lowercase digits and symbols. Have fun doing this on the on-screen keyboard
* The UI is laggy. The reason for having to type in the game center password was because the UI was still loading the system appleid as I was pressing the "Press here to login button". First nothing happened, then the button turned into a "Press here to sign out button" and then the device reacted to my button press. *Thank you*
* The old AppleTV supported either the Remote app on an iPhone or even a bluetooth keyboard for character entry. The new one doesn't support any of this, so there's really no way around the crappy on-screen keyboard.
* While the device allows you to turn off automatic app updates, there is no list of apps with pending updates. There's only "Recently updated", but that's a) limited to 20 apps, b) lists *all* recently updated apps, c) gives no indication what app is updated yet and what isn't and finally d) isn't even sorted by date of the last update. This UI is barely acceptable for enabled automatic updates, but completely unusable if you want them disabled to the point that I decided to just bite the bullet and enable them.
* The sound settings offer "Automatic", "Stereo" and "Dolby Surround". Now, "Dolby Surround" is a technology from the mid-90-ies that encodes one additional back-channel in a stereo signal and is definitely not what you want (which would be "Dolby Digital"). Of course I've assumed that there's some "helpfulnes" at work here, detecting the fact that my TV doesn't support Dolby Digital (but the playbar does, so it's perfectly fine to send out AC/3 sinal). Only after quite a bit of debugging I found out that what Apple calls "Dolby Surround" is actually "Dolby Digital". WHY??
* The remote is *way* too sensitive. If you so much as lift it up, you'll start seeking your video (which works way better than anything I've seen before, but still...)
* Until the first update (provided without changelog or anything the like), the youtube app would start to constantly interrupt playback and reload the stream once you paused a video once.
* Of course in Switzerland, Siri doesn't work, even though I would totally be able to use it in english (or german - it's available in Germany after all) Not that it matters because the Swiss store is devoid of media I'd actually be interested in anyways and there's no way for third-parties to integrate into the consolidated system-wide interface for media browsing.
* Home Sharing doesn't work for me. At. All. Even after typing in my Apple ID password a third time (which, yes, it asked me to).
* It still doesn't wake up on network access, nor appear in the list of Airplay-able devices of my phone when it's in sleep mode. This only happens in one segment of my network, so it might be an issue with a switch though - wouldn't be the first time :/

I'm sure as time goes on we'll see updates to fix this mess, but I cannot for the life of me understand why Apple thought that the time was ready to release this. 

Again: It works fine and I will be brining one to my mother next Friday because I know she'll be able to use it just fine (especially using the Plex app). But this kind of lack of polish we're used to on Android and Windows. How can Apple produce something like this?
