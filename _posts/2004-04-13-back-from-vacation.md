<p>
I was away during the easter-days and now that I'm back, I had to see that my blog somehow got recognized by the various spammers around here: I've just deleted 10 spam entries from the comments.
</p><p>
Those entries are primarely made to get a better PageRank at Google, but since I've upgraded to MovablaType 2.665 which uses a redirector for all links, this does not get the spammer anything, so it's just annoying and does not even bring profit to those f***ing spammers.

Why is there always someone to destroy something good?
