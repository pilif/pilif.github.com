<p>What you see here is the recent history view of my DSPAM - our second line of defense against SPAM.</p>
<p>Red means SPAM. (the latest of the messages was a quite clever phishing attempt which I had to manually reclassify)</p>
<p>To give even more perspective to this: The last genuine Email I received was this morning at 7:54 (it's now 10 hours later) and even that was just an automatically generated mail from Skype.</p>
<p>To put it into even more perspective: My DSPAM reports that since december 22th, I got 897 SPAM messages and - brace yourself - 170 non-spam messages of which 100 were subversion commit emails and 60 other emails sent from automated cron-jobs.</p>
<p>What I'm asking myself now is: Do these spammers still get <em>anything</em> out of their work? The signal-to-noise ratio has gone down the drain in a manner which can only mean that no person on earth would actually still read through all this spam and even be stupid enough to actually fall for it.</p>
<p>How bad does it have to get before it gets better?</p>
<p>Oh and don't think that DSPAM is all I'm doing... No... these 897 mails were the messages that passed through both the <a href="http://www.heise.de/ix/nixspam/dnsbl_en/">ix DNSBL</a> and SpamAssassin.</p>
<p>Oh and: Kudos to the DSPAM team. A recognition rate of 99.957% is really, really good</p>
