If you can read this, then it has happened - this blog moved again.

Eons ago in internet time, [this project has started](/2002/11/welcome/) wich lasted for 4 years at which point I got spammed so badly that I had to move away.

So, still ages ago, [I moved to Serendipity](/2006/06/new-face-new-engine-new-everything/) which fixed the spam issue for me.

This lastes only two years before [I moved again](/2008/03/another-new-look/)to WordPress this time - the nicer admin tool and the richer theme selection pushed me over the edge.

While I'm still happy with WordPress in general, over time I learned a few things:

* while running your own server is fun, having it compromised is not. Using
  any well-known blogging engine that relies on server-side generation of  
  content is ultimately a way to get compromised unless you constantly patch 
  security issues, taking up a lot of time in the process.

* While the old name of this blog (gnegg) was a cool pun for people who knew
  me, it didn't at all convey my identity on the internet. Me? I'm
  [pilif](http://pilif.me), so this should be conveyed at least by the URL

* Most of my posts very relying heavily on custom markup, making the WP
  WYSIWYG editor more annoying than useful.
  
So when [@rmurphey](https://twitter.com/rmurphey) [blogged about octopress](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2011/07/25/switching-to-octopress/) I immediately recognized the huge opportunity [Octopress](http://octopress.org) provides:

I can host static files on a server I don't own and thus don't have to care about compromising, I can blog using my favorite tools (any text editor and git) and I still get an acceptable layout. 

So here we are - at the end of yet another conversion.

While the old URLs already 301 redirect, pictures are still missing and I'll work on getting them back. The comments I'll try to port over too the moment I see how disqus handles my WordPress export.

The gnegg branding is gone and has been replaced by something that doesn't look like a name but isn't while still being a fun pun for people who know me. The tagline, of course, stays the same.

So.

Welcome to my new home and let's hope this lasts as long as the previous instances!
