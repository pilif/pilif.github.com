<a href="http://scummvm.sourceforge.net/">ScummVM 0.3.0b</a> has been released a couple of days ago even without the agreement between the project group and <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com">LucasArts</a>. ScummVM is a free (as in speech) engine capable of running most of the old Lucas Arts Adventures everyone likes so much.

Why is this important? All the older games (read: all the good ones) came out when computers where powered by DOS (mostly MS-DOS) and had an original Soundbalster ISA Card (or something compatible to it). Even with <a href="http://ntvdm.cjb.net/">tricks</a> it's impossible to get those old games to run with sound on most of the modern systems.

And this is where ScummVM kicks in: The program runs on many modern OSes and understands the format the old games where written in (the actual executable was also just an interpreter back then) and thus allows to play the original games in the new environement. Of course you still need the original game, but who doesn't?

The sad thing: LucasArts did not seem to understand what the project is acutally doing and tried to shut it down using the dammed DMCA. Forunately the voices of many fans stopped LucasArts from proceeding and they began negotiating an agreement with the ScummVM Group. But just read <a href="http://scummvm.sourceforge.net/">here</a> (last paragraph of the announcement).

Anyway: I did not have the time to test the new version, but the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=126358">Release Notes</a> look promising.
