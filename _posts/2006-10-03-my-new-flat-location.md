<p>As <a href="/archives/313-Where-have-I-been.html">I've told before</a>, I'm moving into my very own flat quite soonish.</p>
<p>I can't show pictures of the interior just yet as the current owners have not moved out yet. What I can show you though is a picture of the surroundings:</p>

<p>The picture was ripped off the <a href="http://www.gis.zh.ch/gb4/bluevari/gb.asp">GIS Browser</a> Zürich provides for us. I could have used <a href="http://map.search.ch">map.search.ch</a> (which had AJAX before google maps and also has a prettier zoom than its hyped counterpart, btw) and I could even have created a link, but that would kind of give away my address (and the images of the GIS browser have a much higher resolution).</p>
<p>But now to the flat itself:</p>
<p>The green stuff to the north of the building is forest. And there's a nice creek flowing through it (in a more or less straight east -&gt; west line). The forest also is quite big: It takes you about 2 hours to walk from the entrance on the west to the exit on the east.</p>
<p>Additionally, my parents live in the vicinity the forests top end, so it'll be a very nice walk for me when I visit them and decide to go by foot or bike.</p>
<p>Forest, no streets... way off the city life?</p>
<p>Not at all: The place is located near Zürich and I reach my work place by train (<a href="/archives/98-Some-suburban-railways-I..html">Forchbahn</a> even) in only just 9 minutes - or 20 if I decide to walk through the forest.</p>
<p>So I'm getting the best out of two worlds: Nature literarily just outside my front door (I'll be getting myself a cat next year) and still closer to my work space than before. And about the same distance away from the central parts of Zürich as I'm right now.</p>
<p>Granted: Walking home right now is more or less walking in-plane when it will be uphill later on, but it will be in the middle of the forrest, aside a creek as oppsed to a walk through the city.</p>
<p>But that's not all just yet.</p>
<p>It's very nearby the place where I've grown up.</p>
<p>Despite moving away from there back in 1993, I never bonded as much to any other place. That old place still feels like home to me and I'm getting warm feelings whenever I'm passing by.</p>
<p>Now I'm moving to a place where I was playing when I was a kid - granted, we weren't there every free minute as it was a bit off, but we visited that forest here and then - we even once played quite close to where the house is.</p>
<p>And only three years ago, I used dry-ice to make bottles of PET explode - right in the same forest - also quite near the place where I'll be living.</p>
<p>All these features make this flat the truly amazing thing it is. Granted: Room for a nice <a href="/archives/318-Upgrading-the-home-entertainment-system.html">home cinema</a>, a large bathtub, a <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html">Squeezebox</a> in every room, heck, 140m<sup>2</sup> of room - all that is nice. But what really makes the flat special is its location.</p>
<p>November 1st, I'll officially be its owner and then I'll be able to post some pictures from the inside.</p>
