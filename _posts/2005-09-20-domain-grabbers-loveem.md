<p>Well... pilif.ch is gone. I forgot to pay the renewal fee for one single day and the next day, the domain is in the hands of a domain grabber. I'm sure, nic.ch has some sort of deal with them to automatically forward expired domains.</p>
<p>I'm really grateful for that. And I'm also grateful that I did not get a warning in advance (which happened because of a wrong address in their database - mea culpa).</p>
<p>So: Visit <a href="http://www.lipfi.ch">lipfi.ch</a> for my personal webpage.</p>
<p>To be honest, I would not have resurrected the thing if it was only about www.pilif.ch, but I had lots of other services running on subdomains, services on which I depend on (like the administration tool for this blog)</p>
<p>Well... if you are one of the users of any of those services, replace pilif.ch with lipfi.ch and continue to use them as usual.</p>
<p>Stupid domain grabbers</p>
