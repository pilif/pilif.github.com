No. This is not about the new iPods, Apple announced today (of course I've ordered myself a 30GB one, but this really is another history).

I'm just very pleased that two Bugs in <a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a>'s current CVS-Version that have been fixed by Slava the same day, I've reported them. This is just great!

If you are in need of a good editor, go and get jEdit!
