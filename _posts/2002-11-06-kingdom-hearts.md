Yesterday evening I played another round of Square's newest RPG, <a href="http://www.squaresoft.com/playonline/kingdomhearts/index1.html">Kingdom Hearts</a> and I have to admit, this is the first Square RPG which I don't really like. Although it's from the same team as the Final Fantasy Series, it's more like Zelda than FF. With one difference: The camera sucks. When playing an action RPG like Zelda, it's important to have your characters always in view and to know where you will be jumping to. Unfortunatly the camera in KH is quite buggy and thus you run into situations where you cannot see where to jump next. Rotating the screen does not work either as it's quite jumpy and seems to know better what the user wants than the user does...

And: What I like best about the FF series (at least the newer games) or even more in Xenogears, is the complex story in those games. Unfortnuatly, KH's story is soooo obvious and simple. And finally to the battle-system: As I said, it's like Zelda. But in Zelda there is only Link to take care of. In KH, it's three characters. Two of them are controlled by the KI and they have a tendency to senslessly use Ethers and Potions all the time which would not be that a big problem if only those where not that expensive to get...

After all, the only two things I like in the game are its graphics and its sound effects.

I hope, Xenosaga comes out soon...
