It' done. I've not only sucessfully survived the relaunch of our broadband-portal <a href="http://www.superspeed.ch">Superspeed</a>, I too have survived the installation of a new server at a new location. Although I've had muc htoo less time, I think, everything should be working again - everything besides my <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssissin</a> installation which I will again patch to use my mailserver virtual user sql authentication scheme. And believe me: After my todays look at my non-spam-assasinated mailbox, I came to the conclusion, that this issue has my top priority ;-)
