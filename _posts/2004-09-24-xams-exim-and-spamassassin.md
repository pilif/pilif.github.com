<p>It just came to me, that with the new custom_query-option for the SQL-preferences, it will finally be prossible to integrate <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a> 3.0.0 into <a href="http://www.xams.org">XAMS</a></p>
<p>For those that do not know: XAMS is a sophisticated configuration for handling multiple virtual email domains, keeping all users in a strictly normalized MySQL database.
</p>
<p>In contrast to things like vpopmail, it's easy to set up, does not require patches to any software component involved and is extremely feature-rich.</p>
<p>XAMS was built by Oliver Siegmar, taking my <a href="http://www.pilif.ch/mail.txt">initial idea</a> (german. written von de.comm.software.mailserver), cleaning it up and adding a web interface</p>
<p>I posted my SpamAssassin configuration to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5638889&forum_id=8171">XAMS Mailinglist</a>, so read it there.</p>
