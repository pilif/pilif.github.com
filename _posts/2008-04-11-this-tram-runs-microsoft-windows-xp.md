<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/tramcrash.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-397" title="General Protection Fault" src="http://www.gnegg.ch/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/tramcrash-300x213.jpg" alt="Image of the new station information system in some of Zurich\'s tramways with a Windows GPF on top of the display" width="300" height="213" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The trams here in ZÃ¼rich recently were upgraded with a really useful system providing an overview over the next couple of stations and the times when they will be reached.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today, I managed to grab this picture which once again shows clearly why windows maybe isn't the right platform for something like this. Also, have a look at the amount of applications in the taskbar (I know, the picture is bad, but that's all I can get out of my mobile phone)...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If I was tasked with implementing something like this, I'd probably use Linux in the backend and a webbrowser as s frontend. That way it's easier to debug, more robust and less embarassing if it blows up.</p>
