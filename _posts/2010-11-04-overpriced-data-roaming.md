You shouldn't complain if something gets cheaper. But if something just gets 7 times cheaper from one day to the next, then that leaves you thinking whether the price offered so far might have been a tad bit too high.

I'm talking about Swisscom's data roaming charges.

Up to now, you paid CHF 50 per 5 MB (CHF 10 per MB) when roaming in the EU. Yes. That's around $10 and EUR 6.60 per <strong>Megabyte</strong>. Yes. Megabyte. Not Gigabyte. And you people complain about getting limited to 5 GB for your $30.

Just now I got a <a href="http://www.swisscom.ch/NR/exeres/FC2C644E-DFB7-49E4-8326-93C03D317BAF,frameless.htm?lang=de">press release</a> form Swisscom that they are changing their roaming charges to CHF 7 per 5 MB. That's CHF 1.40 per MB which is <strong>7 times cheaper.</strong>

If you can make a product of yours 7 times cheaper from one day to the other, the rates you charged before that were clearly way too high.
