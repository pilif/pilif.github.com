<p>FreeNX is the GPLed variant of <a href="http://www.nomachine.com/">NoMachines</a> NX product.</p>
<p>While exporting X-Sessions never has been a problem, it was kind of slow especially on connections with limited bandwidth. NX tries to solve this by using some tricks at the X11-protocol level, a little proxy-server and a big local bitmap cache. They promise fluently working X-Sessions even over a 56K modem.</p>
<p>Well. I have installed KDE and now FreeNX on my Mac Mini, which I bought for the sole purpose of being a little home-server/VPN-Gateway. My <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/238-The-greatest-gadget-ever.html">NSLU2</a> while being a really nice little thing, does not work with OpenVPN due to the kernel lacking TUN-support.</p>
<p>Installation was easy and flawless - besides forcing me to forward port 5000 to the NATed mac mini as the commercial (freeware) windows-client seems to have problems with the FreeNX-server when tunneling the X-Session over ssh.</p>
<p>The client works very well too. And I can say: It's fast. Very, very fast.</p>
<p>Some more things to note about the screenshot:</p>
<ul>
 <li>While I usually had the policy to name servers after persons and then locations from "lord of the rings", I somewhat run out of names, so I began using names from RPGs. My Mac Mini is called Shion, after Shion Uzuki of Xenosaga. </li>
 <li>I'm running <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>, of course.</li>
 <li>Installing FreeNX is as easy as <tt>emerge nxserver-freenx</tt> on Gentoo.</li>
 <li>The screenshot is of a session exported at 800x600 pixels. Using more pixels does not slow down the session siginficantly, but those 800x600 where comfortable to use on my current display so I can have other things besides the session.</li>
</ul>
