<p>The most pleasant experience I ever had when installing a webbased application was when I was installing <a href="http://gallery.sf.net">Gallery 2 Beta 1</a>. I've never seen such a polished assistant. I've never seen a webbased installer work so well as the Gallery one did.</p>
<p>While I was really, really happy with this, I have not blogged about it (shame on me).</p>
<p>But now that I have updated to Beta 3, this really, really is cause for a blog entry. </p>
<p>The update-process uses the same assistant-type as the installer and is just as pleasant and unproblematical as the installation process. Call your gallery, read, click "next", repeat. Done. Fast, pleasant and error-free.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the gallery team. You rock!</p>
<p>On and the gallery is <a href="http://www.pilif.ch/gallery2/">here</a></p>
