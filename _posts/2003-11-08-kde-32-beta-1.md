I finally found some time to compile the current Beta Version of the upcoming <a href="http.www.kde.org">KDE</a>-Release.

Although it needs quite some more time to start, the overall speed-impression seems much faster.

The user expirience can be explained by one word: slick (very slick, actually).

What a nice work!

I'll definitely post something more as soon as I finished reviewing it

Many thanks to the KDE-Team for this great release - actually the first one where I not only like the functionality, but also the look of it. Very nice indeed.
