Apple finally has released iSync 1.1 with <a href="http://www.apple.com/isync/devices.html">P800</a> support, although it remains to be seen whether this support is just for iSync or also for the adressbook which, in my oppinion, is the killer-feature of apples bluetooth initiative.

I will definitely try that out sometime in the future, but not now: I was weak and could not resist from buying myself a SonyEricsson <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/t610">T610</a> which is - besides the known problem with heavy noise while making calls - the best cellphone I've seen so far:
<ul>
 <li>It's very small. It's very comfortable to finally not have to remove the phone from my pocket when I sit down
 <li>The UI looks great. OK. That should not be important, but it's a point anyway.
 <li>It has a *real* AT-Interface which even resembles the one of the T68 very much. This makes tools like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fma">MobileAgent</a> (an excellent freeware for Windows) possible.
 <li>It has a T9-dictionary: Although I thought that the handwriting would be fast, T9 is much faster for text-entry.
 <li>It has a really good keypad: Like the T68, the T610 has a really great keypad - the best I've seen so far.
 <lI>It has no blinking LEDs - uncommon for Ericsson phones, maybe a tribute to Nokia?
</ul>

The only drawback are the limited PIM functionality and much lesser (and less sophisticated) software, but I can more then live with those problems.

I just hope, they will fix the problem with the noise - and I hope they will do the repair for free.
