<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1436357,00.asp">This</a> review of logitechs diNovo wireless desktop was slashdotted today. I wonder why the reviewer does not say anything about the stupid size of the delete key which actually spans both rows of this 2 by three row with the page-up/down, home and end keys. Insert is where you exspect scroll-lock to be which is missing.

You can't believe how many times I mass-deleted some files in <a href="http://www.totalcommander.com">Total Commander</a> instad of just marking them.

Then again, maybe this layout will be the new "standard": Looking at the other reviewed desktops, the one from Microsoft also has this layout and because of the slashdot-effect I cannot check out the others.

By the way: Besides this delete-problem, the diNovo is the best keyboard I ever had so far: Great typing-feeling, great design and good access-technology (it you can live with <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/000078.html">this</a>)
