<p>Already <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/167-Mountains.html">another year</a> has passed.</p>
<p>It's fresh air time for me!</p>
<p>Hopefully (though not likely unfortunately), the weather will be better this time, but in the end I suppose it does not matter. It's about nature, free time and Evelyn, the best girlfriend in the world</p>
<p>As of tomorrow, I will be off for one week of holiday.</p>
<p>PS: I wonder how many points of rested bonus this will get me in <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">WoW</a> :-)</p>
