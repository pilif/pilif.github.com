This is great. This makes me incredible happy as it documents quite a relevant part of my live, which <a href="http://www.lipfi.ch/info/rit/index.php">I though was long gone</a>. Here is it:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.lipfi.ch/pilif/">My old webpage</a></p>
<p>And even more: <a href="http://www.lipfi.ch/pilif/fabedit">Fabedit</a>, too is still there.</p>
<p>I took the time to fix all long dead links and the syntax of the navigation tree, so it works in Mozilla (somewhat). Hell, I even fixed those little cgi-scripts.
</p>
<p>I first thought, that <a href="http://www.lipfi.ch/pilif/fabgrats">fabgrats</a> was lost, but I found a copy of it lying somewhere else. This is so incredibly great!</p>
<p>So. What's the fuss?</p>
<p>In the years 96 till 2000, I was <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?safe=images&ie=UTF-8&as_uauthors=Philip%20Hofstetter&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1996&as_maxd=31&as_maxm=12&as_maxy=2000&lr=&hl=en">quite active</a> in the web. The freeware tool <a href="http://www.lipfi.ch/cgi-bin/pilif/frameset.pl?template=bestbrowser.tml&right=http://www.lipfi.ch/pilif/english/application/rasintask/rit.html">RasInTask</a> [the page has an usability defficit. There are some deeper links on the right side under "subtopics"] (unfortunately I lost the installer, so you cannot download the tool any more - unless you want to use the source, which is well-conserved) was quite well-known in the net. I actually got quite good reviews in two german magazines and I had quite some fans.</p>
<p>And I did more. I wrote articles, short stories, delphi components and such stuff. All of it, so I do think now, was kind of compensation for what I was not getting in real-life. Respect and a girlfriend. So this old page is not only interesting from a technical standpoint (I think, despite it being a bit amateurish, it was quite good back then [just look at how it's possible to link directly into the page with an unique url despite frames being used. I did this with the RasInTask link above] - not to speak about RasInTask which I still think is quite good, though no one would use it these times), but also from a psychological.</p>
<p>This relict from old times is quite a good proof that people, extroverted on the web are quite different in the real live. And while I'm still kind of active in the net world, I think I can say about myself, that I'm finally adjusing my real live to what I always was on the net. This is a good thing, it seems.</p>
<p>So, what's there for you, my fellow reader?</p>
<p>Not much. An <a href="http://www.lipfi.ch/cgi-bin/pilif/frameset.pl?template=bestbrowser.tml&right=http://www.lipfi.ch/pilif/english/other/hp/index.html">old picture of mine</a>, some texts written in quite bad english and this nostalgic flair of a webpage done in the 90ies. The only thing probably useful to you is, unfortunately, lost (and I really don't think that you can still compile the sourcecode of RasInTask any more)</p>
<p>
For me it's something different. Its a testimonial of who I was and who I've become. Yes. Those years between 99 and 02 where great. And quite a lesson for me. It's good to finally feel grown up after such a long time. And it's good to see who I was, just to learn, who I really am.</p>
<p>Oh. And I will go back to more technical stuff the next time. I promise</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> I actually found the RasInTask installer somewhere, so it's available do download now. But plase note: I know that the code is not very clean. I'm quite convinced that there are some access violations and synchronization errors just waiting to annoy you. So while it's interesting from a nostalgic point of view, I'd recommend against installing it. Oh! And don't ask me for support. I have not touched this fo years.</p>
