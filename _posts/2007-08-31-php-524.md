<p>Today, the bugfix-release 5.2.4 of PHP has been released.</p>
<p>This is an interesting release, because it includes my fix for bug <a href="http://bugs.php.net/?id=42117">42117</a> which I <a href="/archives/365-PHP,-stream-filters,-bzip2.compress.html">discovered and fixed</a> a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>This means that with PHP 5.2.4 I will finally be able to bzip2-encode data as it is generated on the server and stream it out to the client, greatly speeding up our windows client.</p>
<p>Now I only need to wait for the updated gentoo package to update our servers.</p>
