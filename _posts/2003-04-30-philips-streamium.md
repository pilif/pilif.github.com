I got my hands on a <a href="http://www.streamium.com/">Philips Streamium</a>. Not because I wanted one, but because I'm going to write a review for our <a href="http://www.superspeed.ch">broadband portal</a>. I really wondered whether it was possible to use the device without the stupid musicmatch jukebox, so I went behind the scene using a network sniffer.

I will post a deeper review of what I've found (its just plain old XML over HTTP) later this day, because now I have to do some real work. Till then, you can have a look at the exchange between my musicmatch and the streamium <a href="/files/smlog.txt">here</a> (and before you ask: I really have bought all the CD's from which I have ripped the MP3's you will see in the log. I rarely ever download music from P2P Networks).
