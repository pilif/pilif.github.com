<p>About two or three weeks ago, I discovered a new passion of mine: cooking.</p>
<p>Don't laugh. Cooking is like programming: Doing it is a lot of fun and its rewards - when done right - are worth so much more than any work you could have put into it - especially if you value a good meal as much as I do.</p>
<p>With cooking, there comes cleaning of dishes and various tools you need while doing your job</p>
<p>Last Saturday, after preparing a nice and very tasty tomato soup, I put a knife like the one you are seeing to the right (thanks <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiegemesser">Wikipedia</a>) into the dish water - together with other dirty things, ready to clean them up.</p>
<p>Then I grabbed into the foam-covered dish to take out one of the things in to to rinse it clean.</p>
<p>I'm sparing you the picture of how my finger looked once I finished pushing it into the blade of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_knife#Mincing">mincing knife</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing how the finger looks right now, I'm pretty sure I should have gone to a doctor to have it sewn, but I didn't have time for it back then and now it's healed enough that sewing won't do any good without reopening the wound which I certainly don't want anybody to do right now (it stopped hurting this morning).</p>
<p>On the upside, I will have a nice scar to show around :-)</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Don't put knives into foam covered dish water</li>
	<li>Typing with nine fingers is quite hard if one of the disabled fingers is your middle-finger</li>
	<li>Cooking can be a painful experience.</li>
	<li>We never stop learning.</li>
	<li>Blogs really are pointless sometimes</li>
</ol>
