<p>Yesterday, my provider announced an upgrade to their bandwith offerings to up to 10 Mbit/s.</p>
<p>Of course I went ahead and updated my 6Mbit subscription to the new speed.</p>
<p>And look: The change has already been applied.</p>
<p>This means that I now have 10 Mbit/s downstream and - which is becoming more and more important to me - the decent upstream of 1Mbit/s.</p>
