<p>You know what's one of the greatest things to happen on the evening of a workday?</p>
<p>You come home, select 'Play Movie' on your <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/features/harmonytopics/CH/EN,crid=2079,categoryid=396">Harmony Remote</a> and watch the <a href="http://speeddemosarchive.com/BanjoTooie.html">speedrun</a> that downloaded itself while you were on the office. (using Windows Media Center. Sorry, but that has the advantage of just working).</p>
<p>This is the future. This is like watching TV with the full control of the program.</p>
<p>Why should I watch TV only to see programs I don't want to for most of the time? Why should I cope with advertisments every 10 minutes? Why should I be forced to watch all the movies in the german synchronized version?</p>
<p>Not with me. This is what the internet is for. This is why I'm running a linux server at home.</p>
