On <a href="http://graemef.com">graemef.com</a> I read that Windows XP SP2 <a href="http://graemef.com/blog/archive/2004/03/15/635.aspx">will have integrated bluetooth support</a>. This could prove useful as I don't really like the Widcomm Stack - even more so because it does not allow me to log into windows using my BT keyboard - the driver simply isn't loaded yet.

So it was nice to learn, that MS has released the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2predl.mspx">RC1 of the SP2</a> sometime last week.

I've installed it, removed the widcomm-stack, rebooted and Windows recognized my Bluetooth-Hardware. Then I've added my Logitech Keyboard and - it works. I can now log in using the bluetooth keyboard - without the external Logitech Bluetooth hub. Nice!
