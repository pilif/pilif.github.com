I'm a usually very happy customer of <a href="http://www.cablecom.ch">Cablecom</a>. They provide internet-over-tv-cable and as here in Switzerland, basically everyone has tv cable and because they provide nice pure ip addresses (no PPPoE stuff) and because when you are not trapped in the administrative trap, then it just works. Cablecom internet is never down, very speedy and usually I'm envied for my pings in online matches of whatever game.

All these are very good reasons to become a customer of Cablecom and depite of what you are going to read here shortly, I would probably still recommend them to other users - at least those with some technical background because, quite frankly, of all the ways to get broadband here in Switzerland, this one is the one that works the easiest and the most consistent.

But once you fall into the administrative trap, all hell breaks lose.

Here's what happened to me (also, read my other <a href="/2006/11/living-without-internet-at-home/">post about Cablecom's service</a>):

Somewhere around the end of May I got a letter telling me that I would get sent a new cable modem. Once I've got that, I should give them a call so they can deactivate my old one. Also, if I don't call, they'd automatically disable the old modem after a couple of weeks.

Unfortunately, I never got that modem. I don't know who's to blame and I don't care. Also, I could not have anticipated the story as it's now unfolding because the letter clearly said that I'd get the modem at an unknown later date, so I wasn't worried at the time.

At the beginning of June, I've noticed the network going down. Not used to that, especially not as it was down for a whole day, I called the hotline and told them that I suspected them of shutting of my service despite me not reciving the modem.

They've confirmed that and promised me to resend the modem. Re-enabling the old one was not possible they've told me futher on.

One week later - not having recived the modem - I've called again and they told me that the order was delayed due to some CRM software change at their end, but they've promised me to send it that week.

Another week passes. No modem. I call again and they tell me that the reporcessing of orders was delayed, but that I will get the modem that week for sure. Knowing that this probably won't be the case, I've told them that I will be on vacation and that they should send it to my office address.

Another week passes and I go to vacation.

Another week passes and I call the office to ask if the modem (that was supposed to arrive two weeks ago the latest) has arrived. Of course it didn't. What made me actually make the call was the fact that I've received a press release from Cablecom announcing more customers than ever - the irony of that bringing my memory back to the non-existing internet at my home.

So I called support again. They did notice that my order was late, but they had no idea why it was taking so long, there was no way of speeding it up and they had no idea when I would get the modem (keep in mind that I'm paying CHF 79/mt for not working internet access).

At this point I've had enough and I've called someone higher up I know working at Cablecom.

In the end, I was able to get internet access using that route, but it's not entirely official and I still have not the slightest idea of when/if the problem with my actual account will ever be fixed.

Pathetic.

Still: If everything goes well, then you have nothing to fear. From a technical standpoint, Cablecom owns all other currently widely available methods for broadband internet access, so this is what I will be sticking with. Just be prepared for longer service intermissions once you fall into the administrative trap.
