BeejiveIM is the first multiprotocol IM application for the iPhone that supports the new background notification features of firmware 3.0. Yesterday I went ahead and bought that application, curious to see how well it would work.

And just now my phone vibrated and on the display, there was an IM message a coworker sent me via Google Talk. The user experience was exactly the same as it would have been with an SMS - well - nearly the same - the phone made a different sound.

So the dream I had <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/2003/03/just-like-sms-only-cheaper/">many moons ago</a> (6 years - boy - how time flies) has finally come true, with one difference: Whereas back then the MB cost CHF 7, now it's practically free, considering that I'm unable to actually use up my traffic quota and even then, it's only CHF 0.10 now.

So let's keep that in mind and also consider that SMS pricing hasn't changed in the last six years.

So while IM was 52 times cheaper than SMS back then, now the price advantage ranges from somewhere between 3500 times cheaper and infinity times cheaper.

SMS pricing needs to be looked at. This just <strong>cannot</strong> be.
