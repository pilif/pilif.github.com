The red train you see in this picture is the new model of trains, <a href="http://www.forchbahn.ch">Forchbahn</a>, a small train leading from ZÃ¼rich zu Forch and Esslingen, recently bought. This is the very same train that sohuld have been used for public transport next monday. The first new model for 12 years.

Now it seems that I have to wait for some more time before trying it out ;-)
