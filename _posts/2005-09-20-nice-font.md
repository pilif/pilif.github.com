<p>I have my windows set up with ClearType&trade; enabled. Now, for Longhorn, they have created some new fonts, specially hinted for configurations with ClearType&trade; enabled. One of them - Consolas - has a fixed width and is for use in programming environements for exmple.</p>

<p>I really like this font. It's very easily readable but still looks great and smoothed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in environements without cleartype, it looks <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000356.html">really crappy</a>. One of those environements, unfortunately still is the Java Runtime and with this the Zend Studio. Actually, no single font i've tried in there looks acceptable. The best of them - still - is Courier New which is a real pain.</p>
<p>What I liked most about Consolas is also visible on the screenshot: Usually I'm working on a bright-on-dark editor scheme because it makes the thing a whole lot more readable for me. With consolas I don't need this any more. The font looks good and readable even on a white background. This in turn takes away a lot of strain from my eyes.</p>
<p>Nice. I've copied it over from my Lonhorn VMware-Image to my default working-environement and I'm really, really happy</p>
