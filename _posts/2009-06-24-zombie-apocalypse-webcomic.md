By accident I stumbled across <a href="http://nightzero.com">Night Zero</a> a few weeks ago.

They are creating a series of webcomics set in Seattle after an outbreak of the usual zombie creating virus. As the visual medium, they are using HDR photography which seems to lend itself very well for the topic of the comic (it conveys the surreal and dark theme of the story in general just perfectly)
