<p>Today, I was working on porting a EAN128-parser from Java to C#. The parser itself was initially written in C and porting it from there to Java was already quite easy - sure. It still looks like C, but it works nicely and thankfully, understanding the algorithm once and writing it was enough for me, so I can live with not-so-well looking Java code.</p> <p>What made me write this entry though is the fact that porting the Java version over to C# involved three steps:</p> <ol> <li>Copy</li> <li>Paste</li> <li>Change byte barCode[] to byte[] barCode</li></ol> <p>It's incredible how similar those two languages are - at least if what you are working with more or less uses the feature set C provided us with. </p>
