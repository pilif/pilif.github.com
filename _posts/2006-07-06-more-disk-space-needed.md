<p>Can somebody explain me, why my Mac OS X needs 4 TB of diskspace to encrypt my home directory which currently is about 15 GB in size?</p>
<p>Before I got this message, it wanted me to free another 1KB, btw. When I did that and retried, this message popped up. Unfortunately, I can't reproduce that other message though.</p>
