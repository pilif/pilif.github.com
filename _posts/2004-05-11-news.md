While not that much has happened in the world out there (at least not much of the stuff I usually write about), I have some news about what I've been doing the last few days:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>I've devised quite a cool way to add article images to our <a href="http://www.popscan.net">Barcode Solution</a>. It's quite fast, space efficient and expandable. I'd love to see customers using it.</li>
 <li>I played through Super Metroid on <a href="http://www.zsnes.com">ZSNES</a> very nice indeed. Much nicer than what you get on the Gameboy - especially because it's so loooong.</li>
 <li>Began playing Metroid Prime on my Gamecube. Now that I forced me not to play it like I'd be playing Unreal or so, it's getting quite good. 3D-Shooter-Fans: Take your time, move slowly and explore. Don't rush forward and shoot everything you see.</li>
 <li>Added RSS-Feeds to <a href="http://linktrail.gnegg.ch">linktrail</a> it's not linked for now. Use &lt;trail-url&gt;?rss to see it. As always: I'm going to explain later.</li>
 <li>Had in my hands what is known as XDA, SPV, qTeck: A Windows Mobile based smartphone. We got one from Orange to do some tests with it. Feels nice, has a hell of a GUI but is still too large for me to use regularely</li>
 <li>I've been quite depressed because of the weather here - it's better now. Until tomorrow, at least.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that this roundup is complete, I'm looking forward to posting some more interesting stuff in the future ;-)</p>
