<p>... and I'm on this world for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>Today is my 24th birthday.</p>
<p>Sometime I really would like to be much older than I'm now. I would so much have liked to get the whole IT revolution - as it stands now, the first real program I wrote (besides many complicated batchfiles) was for Windows 95, so I missed all the fun of segmented memory and assembler. Too bad.</p>
<p>Then again: There are those days where I just whish to be younger so I will be able to see even more new technologies rise and vanish before I die. It would be so nice to be still alive when we finally get fusion reactors, warp speed, matter-transporters and all this stuff.</p>
<p>I love technology. I really do.</p>
