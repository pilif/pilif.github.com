<a href="/assets/images/jedit.png"><img src="/assets/images/jedit-thumb.png" width="200" height="136" align="right" /></a> [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org) is a texteditor written in Java. Actually it's not just a texteditor - it's <i>the</i> texteditor. It combines the usage-guidelines known of other programs running under Windows or windows-like environements with the functionality (as an editor, not as a newsreader|webbrowser|filemanager|<<insert whatever else emacs can do) of Emacs.

When you download the current release (you can easily take the current 4.1pre-Release - even the CVS-Snapshot is stable enough for production use [at least for me]) and install it via the provided installer, you will get quite a simple looking UI. So the first thing to to is to load the PlugIn-Manager and to download and install whatever you need. Then restart the program and begin with the configuration-session...

On the screenshot, you can see many of the features I like about jEdit:

* The cool look&amp;feel (install the L&amp;F-Plugin and chose the Metouia-Look to get mine).
* The File-Browser always open on the left side. You have to select it under Global Options/Docking to get it sticking at the left side.
* The search-bar which even supports regular expressions
* The split-view. I am currently looking at the same file, but chaning this is a matter of selecting another tab (install the BufferTabs-Plugin to get those) in one of the views.
* The color-scheme of the editfield. I really like having bright text on a dark background. It's so much easier to read.
* The yellow triangle marks in the gutter of the editfield are for folding the sourcecode. Click them and the associated block will be folded.

Please give jEdit a chance even though it's written in Java: The thing is extremly feature-loaden and really fast. Trust me!
