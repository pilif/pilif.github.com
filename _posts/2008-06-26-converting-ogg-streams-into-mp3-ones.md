This is just an announcement for my newest quick-hack which can be used to on-the-fly convert streams from webradios which use the ogg/vorbis format into the mp3 format which is more widely supported by the various devices out there.

I have created an <a href="/ogg2mp3">own dedicated page</a> for the project for those who are interested.

Also, I really got to like <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a>, not as the commercial service they intend to be (I've <a href="/2008/04/hosted-code-repository/">already written</a> about the stupidity of hosting your company trade secrets at a company in a foreign country with foreign legislation), but as a place to quickly and easily dump some code you want to be publically available without going through all the hassle otherwise associated with public project hosting.

This is why this little script is hosted there and not here. As I'm using git, even if github goes away, I still have the full repository around to either self-host or let someone else host for me, which is a crucial requirement for me to outsource anything.<small><a title="Attribution License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank">
