Three days ago, I finally deceided theat I had to the the OST of my favourite Game, Xenogears. Last year, I bought the OST of Chrono Cross and FFVII through Amazon an had to wait about 3 weeks from order to delivery.

As I really like the Xenogears Soundtrack (no wonder: it's from Yasunori Mitsuda, the same guy that created to soundtrack for Chrono Cross and Chrono Trigger) I did not want to wait this long.

So I gave <a href="http://www.animenation.com/">Animenation</a> a shot. I was surprised when they asked me for a photograph of my credit card for security reasons but I gave it to them anyway. They where satisfied with my picture where I blurred out the mid six digits of the number. I've suggested them that I would gladly provide an unaltered picture, if they would provide me with their GPG Public Key.

What was really amazing: Three days after I placed the order, a small package was on my office-desk: The delivery already arrived.

So: What took amazon 3 weeks to do, was done in 3 days by Animenation! Congratulations! I will definitly buy there again!
