With my recent motivation in posting here, the desire grew to actually create a layout for gnegg.ch. I've asked richard whether he would be so kind to create one which he actually did. Many thanks Richard.

Now my knowledge in HTML is quite limited. The last time I actually did something in HTML besides tweaking some templates here and there to enter some dynamical content in, was about three years ago - way before CSS was something browsers did actually understand.

So - to make things interesting for me, I deceided that I will use no tables, no old-fashioned HTML-hacks, but straight CSS and DIV's for "converting" Richards Photoshop-File to something your browser understands.

At first, it was quite difficult, but I made quite some progress as the time continued. The code looks quite nice too.

But <a href="index2.html">have a look</a> for yourself.

Currently I'm working at adopting the layout to the rest of this MT-based pages which at first will involve quite some reading the documentation. Until I'm ready, the alternative index-page above is the only thing you're going to see about the new layout, but it's already MT-integrated, you if you want, you can bookmark it insted of the old index-page.

I will post some newbie-notes for CSS-beginners later on.
