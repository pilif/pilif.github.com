<p><a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/9/">This Paper</a> was featured on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> today. It's about an implementation of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> based on Microsofts CLR. The following quote speaks for itself:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 I wanted to pinpoint the fatal flaw in the design of the CLR that made it so bad at implementing dynamic languages. My plan was to write a short pithy article called, "Why .NET is a terrible platform for dynamic languages".
</p><p>
Unfortunately, as I carried out my experiments I found the CLR to be a surprisingly good target for dynamic languages, or at least for the highly dynamic specific case of Python. This was unfortunate because it meant that instead of writing a short pithy paper I had to build a full Python implementation for this new platform [...]

This is very interesting. Imagine having access to all the Tools, Components around .NET from a wonderful language like Python. But it does not end here: As your Python code in the end gets compiled to MSIL, you can even create libraries in Python and share them with users of languages like C#. This is nice!
</p>
<p>Too bad I don't speek Python. But then again: If it's working with python: What about Perl? PHP? Unix Shell [;-)]?
