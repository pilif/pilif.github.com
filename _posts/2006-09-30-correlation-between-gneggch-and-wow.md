<p>If you take a look at the <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archive">archive</a> (a feature I've actually only discovered just now), you'll notice quite an interesting distribution of posts here on gnegg.ch</p>
<p>2002 was where all started. November was still a bit slow, but in December I really got into blogging only to let it slip a bit during 2003.</p>
<p>2004, I began subscribing to tons of RSS feeds which provided me with a lot of inputs for my own articles. You'll notice a significant increase of posts during the whole year.</p>
<p>Then, in 2005, my WoW-time began. My first <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/229-World-of-Warcraft.html">WoW-related posting</a> was from February 21st, 2005 and makes a reference to when I bought WoW, which would be - provided I'm calculating correctly - February 15th 2005.</p>
<p>Going back to the archive, you'll immediately notice something happening to the post count: It's steadily going down. From a good 9 entries in January (pre-WoW) down to one entry in October which is more or less when I got my first character to level 60. In November I was affected by my first fed-up-ness of WoW which lasted till January 2006 (post count coming up again - despite having christmas and all which was keeping me away from computers.</p>
<p>Then, in January, I was playing again, getting closer to 60 with my second character in February (just one posting).</p>
<p>March was WoW-less again due to my feeling of not having anything to do any more.</p>
<p>In mid-April, I began playing again and started my third character... (posts going down) - which I got 60 with at the end of May.</p>
<p>June was playing at 60 and before the end of the month, I began feeling fed-up with WoW. And burned out. I clearly felt to have wasted <em>way</em> too much of my life. And I felt like I was truly addicted to WoW. So I used the emergency break and stopped playing.</p>
<p>As you can see, I was back to 16 posts in July which also was due to my "Computers under my command"-series which was easy to do due to the topics being clear in advance.</p>
<p>August is interesting. Have a look at the <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/2006/08.html">month calendar</a> and guess when I took my lv60 character out again!</p>
<p>More or less regular postings here until August 10th. Then nothing.</p>
<p>September is better again because I put my WoW to a deep-freeze again - especially after having seen what WoW does to my other hobbies. gnegg.ch is a very nice indicator in that regard.</p>
<p>So I'm coming to all the same conclusion as <a href="http://www.artofadambetts.com">Adam Betts</a> who <a href="http://www.artofadambetts.com/weblog/?p=117">also stopped playing WoW</a> due to noticing his real life being severely affected by WoW.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft is highly addictive and I know of no person who could say not being affected by this. Once you start to play, you play. Even worse: Even if you think that you got it behind you and that you can control it, it just takes over again.</p>
<p>So for me it's clear what I have to do: I will stop playing. For real this time. No taking out my character again. No-more-playing. I won't delete my characters as they are the result of a lot of work, but I will cancel my subscription.</p>
<p>I'm really grateful for the archive function of gnegg.ch as it was a totally clear indicator of my addiction and it still is a perfect way to prevent me from going back as everyone will know I have due to the post count going down again.</p>
