<p>Last sunday I somehow came across <a href="http://www.s9y.org/">Serendipity</a>.</p>
<p>Besides being the only project where hitting Ctrl-V is simpler than actually spelling the name (let alone pronouncing it), this blogging engine shows much promise for me.</p>
<p>It has some obvious advantages over MT for me:</p>
<ul>
 <li>It's OpenSource. Hacking it isn't a crime.</li>
 <li>It's written in PHP, one of the languages I'm <em>really</em> fluent in.</li>
 <li>It has some great anti-spam-features (though forcing the preview here did help greatly).</li>
 <li>It uses dynamically generated pages instead of statically generating each an every page.</li>
  <li>It has many more features than MT does.</li>
</ul>
<p>My only problem: It does not have an importer for Movable Type. Well, actually, the current CVS HEAD does, but it does not work either. But because of the first two points above, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6270930&forum_id=31275">I could do something about that</a>.</p>
<p>Now, this evening, I will be working on the comments importer and tomorrow you will be able to have a look at how well my patches work (at least with this blogs data)</p>
<p>And sometime later this year, I will be using Serendipity as my blogging engine (hopefully with many more patches by myself). That's for sure!</p>
