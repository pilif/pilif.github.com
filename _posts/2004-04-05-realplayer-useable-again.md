<p> The last time I've installed <a href="http://www.real.com">RealPlayer</a> was back in 96 or so. Since then the have added more stupid icons, popup windows, sales-pitches and such useless features with every new release, while they went great lengths in hiding the free download, giving the impression, that one has to pay to view realvideo content.
</p>
<p>It looks like <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/real/response.html">they finally saw</a> that being nasty and cluttering users systems with trash does not get them anywhere...
</p><p>Not that you get the impression I'm actually visiting the linked page regularly, but it was linked on slashdot today.</p>
