<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>. It was not easy, but not particulary hard either. This is the first step to putting a <a href="http://www.popscan.ch">PopScan</a> frontend to a quite inexpensive barcode scanner with both keypad and display</p>
<p>I really like Linux for extactly these things!</p>
<p>Oh and before I forget: Thanks, Jonas. This was an incredibly good job!</p>
