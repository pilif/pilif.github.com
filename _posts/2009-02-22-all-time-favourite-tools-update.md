It has been more than four years since I've <a href="/2004/06/all-time-favourite-tools/">last talked about</a> my all-time favourite tools. I guess it's time for an update.

Surprisingly, I still stand behind the tools listed there: My love for <a href="http://www.exim.org">Exim</a> is still un-changed (it just got bigger lately - but that's for another post). <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> is cooler than ever and powers <a href="http://www.popscan.net">PopScan</a> day-in, day-out without flaws.

Finally, I'm still using InnoSetup for my Windows Setup programs, though that has lost a bit of importance in my daily work as we're shifting more and more to the web.

Still. There are two more tools I must add to the list:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.jquery.org">jQuery</a> is a JavaScript helper libary that allows you to interact with the DOM of any webpage, hiding away browser incompatibilities. There are a couple of libraries out there which do the same thing, but only jQuery is such a pleasure to work with: It works flawlessly, provides one of the most beautiful APIs I've ever seen in any library and there are tons and tons of self-contained plug-ins out there that help you do whatever you would want to on a web page.
jQuery is an integral part of making web applications equivalent to their desktop counterparts in matters of user interface fluidity and interactivity.
All while being such a nice API that I'm actually looking forward to do the UI work - as opposed to the earlier days which can most accurately be described as <em>UI sucks</em>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> is my version control system of choice. There are many of them out there in the world and I've tried the majority of them for one thing or another. But only git combines the awesome backwards-compatibility to what I've used before and what's still in use by my coworkers (SVN) with abilities to beautify commits, have feature branches, very high speed of execution and very easy sharing of patches.
No single day passes without me using git and running into a situation where I'm reminded of the incredible beauty that is git.</li>
</ul>
In four years, I've not seen one more other tool I've as consistenly used with as much joy as git and jQuery, so those two certainly have earned their spot in my heart.
