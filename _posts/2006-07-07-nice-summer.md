<p>This is what the <a href="http://www.meteoschweiz.ch">Bundesamt f√ºr Meteorologie und Klimatologie</a> (basically the official entity to tell us and the world how the weather in Switzerland is) has to say about the upcoming weather.</p>
<p>It shows a certain nicety in this summer: It's neither just hot (like 2003) nor just cold (like all other years for the last 10 years or so). There are hot days like last week, but there are also the cooler ones like just now where it's raining at comfortable 22 degrees celsius.</p>
<p>And just when you have enough cool weather and want the sun back, it's turning around again just to get colder when it's getting too hot.</p>
<p>I wish every summer could be like this.</p>
