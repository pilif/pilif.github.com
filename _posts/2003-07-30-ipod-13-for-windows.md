Yesterday, Apple has released a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/download/ipodsoftwareupdate13.html">windows installer</a> for the 1.3 firmware. This really is no interesting news as there are so many ways for getting the 1.3 Mac-Firmware to a Windows iPod:

<ul>
 <li>Using a Mac (requires double-reformating)
 <li>Using <a href="http://www.mediafour.com">XPlay</a>
 <li>Using PodTronics <a href="http://www.podtronics.com/ipodupdater.htm">Updater</a>
</ul>

And about this hassle with the not supported 2.0 firmware on old devices: I am quite sure that the new firmware can be installed on old iPods using the last two methods above. Unfortuantly, I don't have the old iPod any more (my father is having much fun with it), so I cannot try this out [and you should not try it either - at least not try it and have the slightest idea I am going to be responsible for what you are doing - I may very well be mistaken]
