<p>First, there was <a href="http://editorials.teamxbox.com/xbox/1651/The-Red-Ring-of-Death/p1/">The Red Ring Of Death</a>, then we got <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/18/ps3-is-following-in-360s-footsteps/">the beep of death</a> and now we got the <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/wii/wiiconnect-bricks-wii-216036.php">Error 110213 of death</a>.</p>
<p>What is it with modern game consoles?</p>
<p>Remember the NES? Plug in, turn on, play.</p>
<p>I know so many people who owned or still own a NES. Not one of them ever had a defective device.</p>
<p>Same goes for the SNES. Or any other console.</p>
<p>Is this obvious degrade in quality the price of ever increasing complexity? Is this <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/133-The-price-of-abstraction.html">the price of abstraction</a>?</p>
<p>I wonder: What will ultimately be the end of ever increasing evolution in technical devices as we know them today: Is it physical limitations like the theory of relativity or is it the plain inability of our brains to comprehend the complexity of the devices we create?</p>
