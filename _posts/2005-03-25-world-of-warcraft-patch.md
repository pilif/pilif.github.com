<p>Today, when I wanted to login with my <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/230-WoW-Language-Hacking.html">somewhat tweaked</a> installation of WoW, I was greeted with an error message telling me something about not being able to verify my version.</p>
<p>This was fixed by temporarily using the US login-servers so that the new patch could be installed.</p>
<p>During installation of said patch I found this note here:</p>
<blockquote>
- Reduced the respawn rate of the troggs on the islands in Loch Modan.
</blockquote>
<p>This is nice - just yesterday I've had some serious problems with those troggs there. Too bad, the patch was released only today when I don't have to go back there.</p>
