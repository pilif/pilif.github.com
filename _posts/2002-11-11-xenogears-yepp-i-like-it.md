This seems to be becoming more game-centered than I intended... However:

Yesterday I did another lengthy session with Kingdom Hearts on my video-beamer and after not being able to kill the boss in Atlantica (Ursula, it's name), remembering the frustrating hours used up for my tries to kill the fish-boss in "Zelda - Majoras Mask", I switched my playstation off, entered the Xenogears-CD and turned it on again.

The next 7 hours where most interesting. I began playing just after Fei and his crew where shot down by Bart when fleeing from the attack against Kislev when I arrived at the Thames fleet. From there I played until the fight against bishop Stone in his gear where I screwed up and deceided that two o clock in the morning is a good time to stop playin anyway (why must this always happen to me in fights after a long cut-scene without a chance to save after having seen it? Square should consider giving the possibility to skip a scene if you at least have seen it once).

All Squaresoft RPG's (with the exception of Kingdom Hearts) have a good deep story, but Xenogears has the best of them. I remember lively when the whole plot araund the Ethos, something the player fears for the whole game, got revealed to Billy. It's jsut great.

If you find the game somwhere, consider buying it. It's just great. I would even suggest you to import an americain PS just for Xenogears as the game was never released here in Europe (I've imported mine for CronoCross which too is great but not nearly as great as Xenogears).
