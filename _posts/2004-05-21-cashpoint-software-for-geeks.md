I'm currently working on a WinCE based POS-System for unexpirienced users in low-profile stores (I took the liberty to black-out the logo at the top as it's not official).

The Screen on this shot shows you the manual price entry screen. The problem:  It seems like the values seem to get interpreted as HEX values...  (see arrow). This is the optimal piece of software for geeky hardware stores ;-)

<p>PS: Of course I fixed this. Actually it never even was a bug as it was wrong on purpose to give me reason for another blog entry</p>
