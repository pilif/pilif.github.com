<ul>
	<li>have a VoIP call going on when a mobile call/SMS arrives</li>
	<li>read Kindle ebooks (I can now, but knowing Apple's stance on "competing functionality", with the advent of iBook, how long do you think this will last?)</li>
	<li>give it to our customers as another device to use with PopScan (It's not down-lockable and there's no way for centralized app deployment that doesn't go over apple)</li>
	<li>plug any peripheral that isn't apple sanctioned</li>
	<li>plug a peripheral and use it system-wide</li>
	<li>play a SNES ROM (or any other console rom)</li>
	<li>install Adblock (which especially hurts on the iPad)</li>
	<li>consistenly use IM (background notifications don't work consistently)</li>
</ul>
The iPhone provides me with many advantages and thus I can live with its inherent restrictions (which are completely arbitrary - there's no technical reason for them), but I see no point to buy yet another locked-down device that does half of the stuff I'd want it to do and does it half-assed at that.

Also it's a shame that Apple obviously doesn't need any corporate customers (at least for a small company, I see no possibility).

I just hope, the open and usable Mac computer remains. I would not know what to go back to? Windows? Never. Linux? Sure. But on what hardware?
