<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441" title="iTunes Visualizaion" src="http://www.gnegg.ch/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/itunes.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="292" />

Up until now I have not been a very big fan of iTunes' visualization engine, probably because I've been spoiled with <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/milkdrop/">MilkDrop</a> in my Winamp days (which still owns the old iTunes display on so many levels).

But with the release of iTunes 8 and their new visualization, I have to admit that, when you chose the right music (in this case it's <a href="http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/browserRedirect?url=itms%253A%252F%252Fax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewAlbum%253Fi%253D70980317%2526id%253D70980839%2526s%253D143459">Liberi Fatali</a> from Final Fantasy 8), you can really get something out of this.

The still picture really doesn't do it justice, so I have created <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/itunes8-visu.mov">this video</a> (it may be a bit small, but you'll see what I'm getting at)Â  to visualize my point. Unfortunately, near the end it gets worse and worse, but the beginning is something of the more impressive shows I have ever seen generated out of this particular piece of music.

This may even beat MilkDrop and I could actually see myself assembling a playlist of some sort and put this thing on full screen.

Nice eyecandy!
