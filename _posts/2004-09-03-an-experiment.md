<p>Now that I have some problems with MT (it's so terribly slow when not using mod_perl), I thought to myself: "Let's do a little experiment. Let's try out <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> and let's see what happens"</p>
<p><a href="http://wp.gnegg.ch/index2.php">This</a> is what happened. And <a href="http://wp.gnegg.ch/index2.phps">this</a> is the source of the template.</p>
<p>So. Was it worth it? How is it, working with WP?</p>
<p>While I really like the dynamical generation feature and the OPML-Upload, I have some problems with WP:</p>
<ul>
 <li>It's not as flexible as MT. All those template-functions output much too much HTML (every little bit of HTML-code is too much, actually). I had to change the stylesheet to accomodate wordpresses forced &lt;ul&gt; in the sidebar. And for the links I actually had to patch around in WP for my template</li>
 <li>MT seems much more polished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway. As WP is written in PHP and contributions are certainly welcome (it's free software after all), maybe I should look into contributing something.</p>
<p>And as for the future of gnegg.ch: I've not deceided yet, what I should do: Adopting the other gnegg.ch templates would take about half a day to one day, which is terribly much time to invest in replacing something that essentially works.</p>
<p>So, as I said <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/movabletype.html">here</a>, I'm going to stay with what I currently have - for now. At least until I hear back from MT about my support ticket, as mod_perl is a requirement for me to be running MT.</p>
