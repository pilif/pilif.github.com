I've just finished a first version of a printing-stylesheet. Now when you print one of the pages here, you will get a more suitable layout without navigation and background-colors.

The more I'm working with stylesheets, the more I begin to like that. There is virtually nothing you can't do, it's quite browser-interoperable, it's easy to do. It's just nice.

Now the only thing left to do is to convice Richard also to use CSS whenever possible so that our company's webpages get the same clean code.

Very nice!
