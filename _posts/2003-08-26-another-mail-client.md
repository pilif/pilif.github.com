It's just not over yet. As a fellow reader of my blog, you may have notticed that I am looking for the <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/000035.html">best email client</a> (read there for my requirements). Becky! which I reviewed back in march really is great, but the threading function does not work very well and neither does GPG or PGP which I made a requirement in our company.

Since very long, I know of the program <a href="http://www.ritlabs.com">The Bat!</a> which was no alternative so far, as it fulfilled all my requirements but being IMAP compliant (apart from that, it's a *really* great program)...

Now they released a <a href="ftp://ftp.ritlabs.com/pub/the_bat/beta/">beta version</a> of The Bat 2.0 which has full IMAP-Support. I am currently looking into that and I'm going to post a full review soon.
