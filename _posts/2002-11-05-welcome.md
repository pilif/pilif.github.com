My first entry to the newly opened gnegg.ch weblog. Here you will find all kinds of stuff, from technical stories over reviews to unimportant stuff I came across, but also announcements if I have time to add more to my full-fledged <a href="http://www.pilif.ch">Webpage</a>. As I am not-so-good&#8482; with layout, I kept the default one of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, my blogging-engine. Maybe <a href="http://www.rhaydon.ch">Richard</a> will help me here sometime in the future.
