<p>I just heard, that my nickname-ever-since has been "misused" by someone in his evil malware-schemes.</p>
<p>At least the second entry in google after searching for "pilif" points to <a href="http://www.iamnotageek.com/a/pilif.exe.php">this page</a></p>
<p>This is very unfortunate. I'm using the name "pilif" since <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32/browse_frm/thread/b30be1ad2e451bdf/d1ce704a9ae46142?tvc=1&q=author:pilif&_done=%2Fgroups%3Fhl%3Den%26safe%3Dimages%26q%3Dauthor:pilif%26qt_s%3DSearch+Groups%26as_drrb%3Db%26as_mind%3D12%26as_minm%3D5%26as_miny%3D1981%26as_maxd%3D6%26as_maxm%3D1%26as_maxy%3D1999%26&_doneTitle=Back+to+Search&scrollSave=&&d#d1ce704a9ae46142">long before the first mail virus</a> (ILOVEYOU) has been written. Pilif has the benefit of being nearly unused in the web so far (very convinient when registering somewhere) and it somewhat contains my name (Philip -> Filip -> Pilif)</p>
<p>I can asssure you that I have nothing to do with this worm or any other worm for that matter.</p>
<p>Besides, if I really wrote a virus I would never be so stupid as to name it after my nickname ;-)</p>
