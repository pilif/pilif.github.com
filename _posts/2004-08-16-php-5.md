As you surely know, <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP 5</a> has been released. Actually, it's already 5.0.1.
</p>
<p>What you also may know is that Gentoo's dev-php/mod_php package was promoted from -x86 to ~x86. This means from broken to unstable in Gentoo-terms.</p>
<p>This means that I can now make some tests with PHP5 which I already began doing: I've upgraded PHP on our developement server to 5.0.1 and it's working quite well so far. The only problem I've come across is this stupid code in a <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com">osCommerce</a> installation:</p>
<pre class="code">
class something{
  function something{
    // do something
   $this = null;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>New or old object model in PHP: This is just something you don't do. Not in PHP, and certainly not in any other language. You should not assign anything to <tt>this</tt>, <tt>self</tt> or even <tt>Me</tt> (or whatever the implicit pointer to your own object is called in your language).</p>
