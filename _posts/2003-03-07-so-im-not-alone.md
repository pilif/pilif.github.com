As I'm quite interested in Apples software, especially Safari and as I'm a big fan of Dave Hyatt's writing stlye, I am a reader of his <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/">weblog</a>, I was quite happy to see that he <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/archives/2003_03.html#002589">seems to like</a> Xenosaga quite a bit ;-)
