I really should have more discipline concerning this little weblog ;-)

Just some notes for now:

<b>P800 and the calendar</b>
About a week ago, after I've updated the SonyEricsson P800 Sync-Software to 1.3.1, it stopped synchronizing my calendar entries. There was no error message, but it did not work either - it id not touch the calendar entries at all. Then I performed a full synchronisation, overwriting the phone with the effect of having no entries at all on the phone.

Reinstalling the Sync-Software did not help. What finally had effect was reinstalling both Office (with outlook), cleaning the Registry from Office-Settings and the Sync-Software (first removing everything and then reinstalling it). This process took about 3 hours (and many of them figuring out how to fix it <i>without</i> having to reinstall everything). Stupid Software.

<b>iPod and Linux</b>
I am running <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> Linux using Kernel 2.4.20-gentoo-r2. Although I had HFS and IEE1394-Support int the kernel, one of the modules (sbp2 I think) oopsed when I plugged my Mac-Formated iPod and <tt>modprobe</tt>'d ohci1394. Reformating the iPod with the FAT32-Filesystem (use the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/download/">Windows-iPod-Updater</a> from apple.com, but remove MacDrive if it's installed - else your iPod will not be detected) did help me with this so I finally have a device to quickly exchange large amounts of data between home and office.

<b>Browsers (1)</b>
Apple recently released Beta 2 of <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a>. Looks great - especially the Tabbed Brwosing-Feature. Too bad I still don't have my own Mac.

<b>Mario</b>
I'm in World 6 of Super Mario Advance 2 and the game really is great. If only the Special World would not be so difficult to master...

<b>Browsers (2)</b>
I recently tried out the latest build of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix">Phoenix</a> which will <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap.html">replace</a> the browser-Part in the Mozilla-Suite someday. It really looks great and is a pleasure to use. I am thinking of dropping Mozilla entirely and use Phoenix for the web an Becky! for email.

So. That's half a month of notable internet expirience. I promise to report more often in the future!
