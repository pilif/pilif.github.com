<p>Today something happened that I never though could happen:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/166-IBM-Thinkpad-42.html">My Thinkpad</a> died.</p>
<p>And I really mean it. The device did noting more than beep once long and twice short. A quick look at the very informative support pages of IBM showed me that the worst possible thing happened: Failure on the System Board or the RAM (which is just as bad as I have only built-in RAM).</p>
<p>A call to the IBM support line got me a ticket number and about half an hour later, they told me to send the machine to their repair center but because I can reach that by train and foot in about 15 minutes from my office, I've asked whether I can bring it to them which they accepted.</p>
<p>So now I'm working on a helplessly underpowered Thinkpad T41 that was lying around in the office. Starting Delphi takes a bit more than a minute just to give you an impression of it's speed (256 MB of RAM is much too less for me)</p>
<p>They told me that the computer will be fixed in two to three days, so I will have to live through the week-end without my beloved Thinkpad. Too bad.</p>
<p>This is the first of about 7 Thinkpads in my life where something like that happened which should speak a lot for their incredible quality. And while this whole story was certainly annoying, the support was helpful and speditive. This is all I could ask for. Thanks IBM.</p>
<p>In case you ask how I could get to work on the new computer so fast: I've removed the harddrive of the defective machine and put it into the older one. While Windows XP comlained a bit about the graphic driver on the new machine, the rest of the hardware was detected flawlessly, so this was extremely un-painful. To be on the secure side non the less, I've created an image of the partition containing my personal data [note to self: Finally blog about your partition scheme].</p>
