I should have posted it yesterday: Both <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird">Firebird</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird">Thunderbird</a> got a little Mozilla 1.5a caused refreshment. Firebird does not crash during autocomplete anymore and thunderbird still works as it used to when I was using the nightly builds. The good thing about Thunderbird 0.1: I got <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/thunderbird.html">Enigmail</a> to work with it (my Public-Key can be found <a href="http://www.pilif.ch/phofstetter.asc">here</a>).
