As a customer of [digitec](https://www.digitec.ch), I often deal with their collection notices which I get via email and which invite me to go to their store and fetch my order (yes. I could have the goods delivered, but I'm impatient and not willing to pay the credit card surcharge).

Ever since Passbook happened on iOS 6, I wished for these collection notices to be iOS Passes as they have a lot of usability benefits:

* passes are location aware an pop up automatically when you get close to the location
* Wallet automatically turns the screen brightness all the way up
* passes could potentially be updated remotely
* once added to the Wallet, passes don't clutter your mailbox and you'll never lose them in the noise of your inbox.

So my latest fun project is [digipass](https://github.com/pilif/digipass).

Next time you get a digitec collection notice, just forward it to

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 32px;">digipass@pilif.me</p>

After a few seconds, you will get the same collection notice again, but with the PDF replaced by an iOS Wallet pass that you can add to your Wallet.

I have slightly altered the logo and the name to make it clear that there's no affiliation to digitec.

The pass will be geo-coded to the correct store, so it will automatically pop up as you get close to the store.

As I don't want access to your digitec account and because digitec doesn't have any kind of API, I unfortunately can't automatically remove the pass when your fetch your order - that's something only digitec can do.

The source code for the server is available under the MIT license.

Disclaimer:

* I'm not affiliated with digitec aside of being a customer of theirs. If they want me to shut this down, I will.
* I am not logging the collection notices you're forwarding me. If you don't trust me, you can self-host, or redact the notice to contain nothing but the URLs (I need these in order to build the pass).
* This is a fun project. If it's down, it's down. If it doesn't work, submit a pull request. Don't expect any support
* The LMTP daemon powering this is running in my home. I have a [very good connection](https://pilif.github.io/2014/09/geek-heaven/), but I also have not signed an SLA or anything. If it's down, it's down (the message will get queued though).
* The moment I see this being abused, it will be shut down. Just like my previous [email based fun project](https://pilif.github.io/2010/04/announcing-tempalias-com/)
