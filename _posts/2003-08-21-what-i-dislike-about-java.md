I really tried to get into programming something in Java. Alone the psossibilities with JSP/Servelets seem very interesting compared to what you get when using PHP. Another thing would be the many excellent IDE's (even free ones like Eclipse) out there that only support java (I know that PHP-Plugins for Eclipse exist, but they are not really usable - a thing I'll write about in the future).

But I never really took off and until today I never really could describe what is holding me back.

Today I found <a href="http://www.ferg.org/projects/python_java_side-by-side.html">this article</a> which explains it by using examples to compare python to java. Although it's about python (a language I don't really like), most of the point in there apply to other scripting languages (PHP, Perl, Ruby,...) too.

Really good read and finally the explanation I was looking for.
