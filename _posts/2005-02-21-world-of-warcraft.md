<p>For the last three years or so, I was constantly thinking about those online RPGs, but the high amount of micro-management you had to do and the steep learning-curve, the newbie-killers and all those other factors led me to ask myself: "Why spending money for that kind of dubious entertainment?"</p>
<p>Then I've read many good things about Blizzards <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a>: It was said to have a nice learning curve, few micro-management and to be entertainment-centered - now we where talking...</p>
<p>So I went ahead and bought it last tuesday.</p>
<p>While there were some problems at first when I tried to create my character (Blizzard was quite overrun by the many people trying it out here in Europe), they were solved the same day and since then I had no problems with long waiting lists or disconnects. So from a technical point of view, it's very satisfying.</p>
<p>And then there's the gameplay of course.</p>
<p>This is very well done: There are many small things where the designers have tried to minimize the problems other MMORPG seem to have: There's no senseless doing stupid jobs with your alter-ego just to earn money (you earn money by beating quests which are somewhat diablo-like). There's this concept of getting double experience points when you log in after a larger pause. Then, if you don't want to play in a designated player-vs-player-area, it's immensely difficult to be slaughtered by another player - if you get killed by another player, it's entirely your own fault. And besides: Other players cannot steal your inventory.</p>
<p>While the game provides an incredible amount of options how to progress your character, it introduces them nice and slowly. I'm still quite the newbie (playing about 2 hours per day I'm now at level 9) and I never felt overwhelmed. Very nice.</p>
<p>The most interesting experience I've had so far was yesterday when I was having problems concluding a certain quest alone: The boar I had to kill was just too strong for me.</p>
<p>So I did the logical thing: I went to the nearest tavern and asked around if there was someone willing to kill that beast with me. I soon found someone and we succeeded. This is what I expect from a MMORPG - not forging horseshoes and selling them for much too less money becuase of ebay-caused inflation - each horseshoe taking about 1000 senseless clicks to build.</p>
<p>So WoW is definitely getting my $11 monthly after my one month trial runs out.</p>
<p>Oh. There's one thing though: Here in Switzerlad, you just get the german version of the game. This is very unfortunate for me as I prefer playing in english realms. Now its quite difficult to talk about something with an other player if I just have my own translation of the german name instead of what's on the screen of the other players.</p>
<p>This is partly my own fault - I could play on a german realm, but partly blizzards too - here in Switzerland, many of us are used to read and understand english - all the movies are shown in the original language (mostly english) with subtitles for example. I think, that many of us would really prefer to have an english version of the game.</p>
<p>I for myself will probably do as I always do: Use the CD-key of the german original with an english copy I get via other channels. This is not particulary legal, but not that illegal too, I think.</p>
<p>Please, Blizzard, if you hear me: Provide us swiss with an english version of your games in the future.</p>
