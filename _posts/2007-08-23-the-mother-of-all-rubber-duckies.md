<p>Last sunday I came across the beauty you are seeing on the right and of course I <b>had</b> to have it.</p>
<p>I took a picture of her (Ebi suggested that it must be female and recommended me to call it "Emma") standing next to a bottle of soap to give you some sense of scale.</p>
<p>Crazy. Cute. Perfect.</p>
