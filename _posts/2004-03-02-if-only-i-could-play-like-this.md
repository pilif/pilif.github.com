Somehow I came across <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/nesvideos.html">this site</a>. This is a collection of videos from someone playing old NES games in an emulator. They try to get through a game as fast as possible.

What this <a href="http://soramimi.egoism.jp/">Morimoto</a> did in Super Mario Bros 3 is quite unbelivable - regardless of which tricks he may have used. Look at <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/torrents/supermariobros3j-timeattack-morimoto.avi.torrent">this video</a> (it's a <a href="http://www.bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">Bittorrent</a>-File)
