<p>It seems like Larry Wall has done it again and released <a href="http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/2004/04/16/a12.html">Apocalypse 12</a> (linked to the print view as you definitely want to print it out). The Apocalypses are nothing religious, but Larry Walls ideas and definitions about the next version of Perl (although I am inclined to call it something else as it's going to be quite different - if it's ever released).</p>

<p>The Appocalypses are quite nice to read. They are not only great from a technological standpoint but from a linguistic and humorous one too. If you have no problems reading 72 pages of technical definitions on quite a high level, go for it and read it. It's a real pleasure and I looked forward to this for over a year now
