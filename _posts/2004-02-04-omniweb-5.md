Last monday, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com">OmniGroup</a> has released the public BETA version of <a href="">OmniWeb 5</a>. The most interesting thing I've seen in it (I'm currently writing this entry using OmniWeb) is this text in the EULA:

<blockquote>
IMPORTANT - Read this License Agreement carefully before clicking on the "Agree" button.  By clicking on the "Agree" button, you agree to be bound by the terms of the License Agreement.
 --

The document that follows this paragraph is a license agreement.  Why do we need such a thing?  Well, to be perfectly honest, our lawyers have told us that we need to protect ourselves.  We at The Omni Group pride ourselves on our low-key style, but the global nature of the software business means that one lawsuit from one user in a far-flung jurisdiction could put us out of business.  It also means that, without this agreement, we might not have protection from people who misuse our software.  We do not want to bet our entire company on such possibilities, however unlikely, because we like doing what we do and want to continue to be able to do it.  And, so, we require you to read and agree to this license.  We think you will find it quite reasonable.  Obviously, if you disagree, click "Disagree."  But, don't just stop there.  Let us know.  Send some e-mail to <info@omnigroup.com> telling us what you find unacceptable about our license agreement.  We can't promise to change anything, but we will do our best to get back to you.

Nice. It's their style, so it does not really surprise me, but it's nice anyway.

What I like is this tab-drawer. I've just seen that even the bookmark-window is displayed as a tab. Very nice. Very integrated.

In the stauts bar there are some Icons. I don't really understand what they are doing and there's no tooltip, but I'm sure, this will be fixed in a later release.

Very good-looking. I'm going to surf around a bit and will possibly post something more later on.

Just before hitting "submit", I've seen this small plus-sign above the scroll bar on any <tt>&lt;textarea&gt;</tt>-element. This thing is just great. When you click on it, an extra window will open providing you with a nice large texteditor and the possibility to import any text file. Nice! Very Nice.

I think, I'm going to find a whole lot of nice little things as I continue trying the thing out.
