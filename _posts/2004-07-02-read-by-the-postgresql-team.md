Seing <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/90603/">this</a> in my referrer-log and seing that Robert commenting <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/105-Quote-of-the-day.html">here</a> is in the PostgreSQL-Team too, I come to the conclusion that someone of the Postgres-Team with obviously enough influence to propose links to the weekly newsletter seems to be reading my humble blog.</p><p>Thank you for mentioning my posting in your weekly news. That was very kind.
