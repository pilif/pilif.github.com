Yesterday, Ebi invited me and my girlfriend over for dinner and a round of trivial pursuit.

I fail to find words to describe how awesomly good the meal has been. I would have wanted to get a fourth serving, but I just couldn't stuff in even a microgram more.

And the trivial pursuit was fun as ever - that game just shines if you don't take it seriously.

Thanks Ebi. I had a blast!
