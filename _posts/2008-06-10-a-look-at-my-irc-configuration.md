It has been a while since I've <a href="/2005/01/irc-clients/">last talked about my irc setup</a>. Last time was when I initially started to get my feet wet in IRC. In the three years (three years already? How time passes!), I have been active in IRC to various degrees (with some large wow-related holes, but that's <a href="/2006/09/correlation-between-gneggch-and-wow/">a different story</a>).

Currently, my rate of IRC usage is back to quite high levels, mostly due to #git which is a place where I actually feel competent enough to help out here and then. Also #nesvideos is fun to be in as ever.

What has changed since 2005 is my setup:

<ul>
    <li>Whereas back then, I was mainly working on Windows, I have by now <a href="/2006/04/praise-to-vlc/">switched over to OSX</a>, so the question of clients is raised again, but see more on that later on.</li>
    <li>By IRC proxy changed from ctrlproxy to <a href="http://znc.sourceforge.net">ZNC</a>. It's easier to configure and I've had much better success with that than with any other bouncer I tried. It's the only bouncer I know so far that does the thing I need bouncers for out-of-the box: Log the channel while I'm away and replay the log when I reconnect.</li>
    <li>The client has radically changed. While I stayed true to X-Chat after my switch to OSX (using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchataqua/">X-Chat Aqua</a>), recently, I have tried other clients as Colloquy (no light-on-dark-theme with colored nicks) and Linkinus (not offering any features making up for the commercial nature), but honestly, <a href="http://www.mibbit.com">Mibbit</a> works best. And it works when I'm on my girlfriend's computer. And it even (somewhat) works on my iPod Touch. And it looks good. And it provides all the features I need. I'm of course still connecting to my bouncer, but that's easily configured once you create an account there.</li>
</ul>

IRC is still a very techie world, but it's such a nice way to spend time on.
