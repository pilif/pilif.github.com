<p>The <a href="http://www.snom.com/snom190_voip_phone.html">Snom 190</a> is a SIP hardware phone which I have ordered recently to continue my asterisk experiment.</p>
<p>Yesterday it arrrived.</p>
<p>I have to say: I love that device. Contrary to those proprietary PBX phones, the Snom 190 is easy to use, provides a big heap of features (complete remote managability, web interface, dialing over http-request (outlook-plugin - here I come)) and does not cost more than what the other companies ask for their lowest entry level phones. The Snom even looks good!</p>
<p>Like many other devices today, the Snom 190 runs Linux (2.4), though this time I have not tried to hack it yet. All the sources including the developement environement are available <a href="http://www.snom.com/snom_source.html">at the website of snom</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to the somewhat crappy ZyXel 2000W which I have tested too, the Snom 190 is ready for productive business.</p>
<p>This makes implementing VoIP at our company seem more and more likely every day.</p>
