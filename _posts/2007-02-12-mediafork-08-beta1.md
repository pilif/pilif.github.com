<p>A few <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/329-ripping-DVDs.html">months</a> <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/330-DVD-ripping,-second-edition.html">ago</a>, I was looking for a nice usable solution to rip DVDs. I was trying out a lot of different things, but the only application that had acceptable usability and speed was <a href="http://handbrake.m0k.org/">HandBrake</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the main developer of that tool has run out of time to continue to develop HandBrake which made the project stall for some time.</p>
<p>Capable fans of the tool have now created a form, aptly named MediaFork and they have just released <a href="http://mediafork.dynalias.com/blog/?p=35">Version 0.8-beta1</a> with some fixes.</p>
<p>But that's not all. Aside from the new release, they also created a blog, set up a <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/303-Developing-with-the-help-of-trac.html">trac</a> environement.</p>
<p>Generally, I'd say the project moved back to be totally alive and kicking.</p>
<p>The new release provides a linux command line utility. Maybe I should go ahead and try it out on a machine even more powerful than my Mac Pro (which is running linux without X) - let's see how many FPS I'm going to get.</p>
<p>Anyways: Congratulations to the MediaFork developers for their great release! You're doing for video what iTunes did for audio: You make ripping DVDs <em>doable</em>.</p>
