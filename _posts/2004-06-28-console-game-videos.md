I've already <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/94-If-only-I-could-play-like-this.html">posted</a> about <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/nesvideos/">this site</a> with its speedruns for old console games. What I did not know back then is that these videos are created using slow motion and savestates which makes them look so expectionally good (if you are up for movies not using savestates, then <a href="http://planetquake.com/sda/other/">this</a> is for you).
</p>
<p>Though the videos are made with savestates, they are extremely fun to watch, so bisqwits page is one of those I have been visiting every day just to look for updates. Recently it went all quiet...</p>
<p>And today I see what was bisquwit keeping from posting new movies: The whole page got redesigned (on a WIKI-basis) and SNES and Genesis (Mega Drive here in Europe) Movies were added.  Very nice. My Bittorrent client is already hard-working ;-)</p>
