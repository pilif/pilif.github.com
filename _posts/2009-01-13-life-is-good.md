Remember <a href="/2009/01/bugs-bugs-and-more-bugs/">last week</a> when I was ranting about nothing working as it should?

Well - this weeks feels a lot more successful than the last one. It may very well be one of the nicest weeks I've had in IT so far.
<ul>
	<li> The plugin system I've written for our PopScan Windows Client doesn't just work, it's also some of the shiniest code I've written in my life. Everything is completely transparent and thus easy to debug and extend. Once more, simplicity lead to consistency and consistency is what I'm striving for.</li>
	<li>Yesterday, we finally managed to kill a long standing bug in a certain PopScan installation which seemed to manifest itself in intermittently non-working synchronization but was apparently not at all working synchronization. Now it works <em>consistently</em>.</li>
	<li>Over the weekend, I finally got off my ass and used some knowledge in physics and and a water-level to re-balance my projector on the ceiling mount making the picture fit the screen perfectly.</li>
	<li>Just now, I've configured two managed switches at home to carry cable modem traffic over a separate VLAN allowing me to abandon my previously whacky setup wasting a lot of cable and looking really bad. I was forced to do that because a TV connector I've had mounted stopped working consistently (here's the word again).

The configuration I thought out worked instantly and internet downtime at home (as if somebody counts) was 20 seconds or so - the TCP connections even stayed all up.</li>
	<li>I finally got <a href="http://www.fireflymediaserver.org/">mt-daapd</a> to work consistently with all the umlauts in the file names of my iTunes collection.</li>
</ul>
If this week is an indication of how the rest of the year will be, then I'm really looking forward to this.

As the title says: Life is good.
