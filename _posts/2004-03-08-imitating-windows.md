The <a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a> fanatics and other <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a>-basher always talk about KDE imitating Windows with it's UI.

Today I've read <a href="http://sdg.agreatserver.com/GNOME_2_6.html">this guide</a> to the upcoming Gnome 2.6 and with pictures like <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/gedit_save.jpg">this</a> (look at the icon, the caption of the buttons and the whole look of the dialog) or <a href="http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/filesel_save.jpg">this</a>, this seems awfully Mac-ish to me. KDE-folks out there: Start bashing Gnome for imitating Mac OS X!
