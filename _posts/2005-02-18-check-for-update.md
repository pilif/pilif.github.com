<p>I've seen many pieces of different software.</p>
<p>Many of them provide the user with a way to go online and check for new versions of the program.</p>
<p>Nearly all of them have the corresponding menu entry in the "Help"-Menu.</p>
<p>Why is that so? Checking for updates does not provide you with help. Maybe, just maybe it can fix a problem you are having - but it's nowehre near providing help.</p>
<p>If I wrote software, it would have this option in the Tools menu or - if the application had none - in the File-Menu, though it's misplaced even there. As is "quit" for example...</p>
