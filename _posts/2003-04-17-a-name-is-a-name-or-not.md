I really saw this mess coming when I read the announcement that Mozilla's Phoenix will be called Firebird for now: <a href="http://firebird.sf.net">Firebird</a> is a spin off of the once open-sourced Interbase-Database Server by Borland existing for three years now and using the name "Firebird" since then.

As you can imagine, the Firebird (DB)-People were not too happy about this - Phoenix had to be renamed because of a naming conflict and the new solution still creates one - but this time it's not a commercional product it's conflicting with - its another Open Source project.

I can understand both sides:

<b>Mozilla</b>
The name Firebird has been checked by Netscapes/AOLs legal departement (why have they not noticed this? or is it maybe that they thought it would not matter?) and another name-change would again involve the legal departement which won't please neither the BIOS vendor Phoenix not the Mozilla-Team as they will not release another milestone called phoenix.

<b>Firebird</b>
Firebrid already suffers from not really be known in the public. The RDBMS it spun off is known mainly by delphi-developers and neither Interbase nor Firebird were often in the press these days. A more known product with the same name will further divert attention. And the psycological reason: The name Firebird <a href="http://firebird.sourceforge.net/index.php?op=history&id=opensource">was chosen</a> based on the real political mess around open-sourcing Interbase and is, in my oppinion, a very well chosen name.

Why I can understand the arguments on both sides, I can neither offer a solution pleasing for both projects (besides the question why Phoenix is not to be called simply "Mozilla" - after all, the Browser-Component in the Mozilla Suite is to be replaced by Firebird (the browser) anyway) nor can I understand the way the folks around Firebird (the DB) <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&page=ibp_Mozilla0">react to the problem</a> (and <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/dave/archives/2003_04.html#003073">here</a> - an entry in Dave Hyatts blog).  War is never a solution - never!
