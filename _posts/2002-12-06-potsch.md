I must confess: I've slept not nearly enough last night. And today I was ICQ-ing a bit with Jonas and we finally came to the point when we found that POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service - the official technical name for the standard analog telephone technology) is quite a nice name.

Following the tradition of buying domain names for internet access technologies (adsl.ch), I went and reserved pots.ch for me.

The domain is active and after about 2 o clock CET, you will be able to reach me at <a href="mailto:ph@pots.ch">ph@pots.ch</a>.

I really like this domain. It comes just after gnegg.ch in the list of strange domain-names I own :-)
