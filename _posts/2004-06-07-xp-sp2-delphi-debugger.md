This weekend, a pre-RC2-Release of Windows XP SP2 could be found on the net. Eager to learn whether the Delphi debugger now works again, I've downloaded and installed the thing.

I'm happy to report, that delphi indeed works again, so I'm keeping the build installed for now, as I really like the integrated bluetooth-support.</p>
