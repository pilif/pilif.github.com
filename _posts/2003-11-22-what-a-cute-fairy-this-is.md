If possible, we try to get the people to return to the site by using contests like about a week ago, where one ended and they needed me to  chose the lucky winner as I did not have the time yet to write a tool taking this work from me.

Anyway: Instead of just reminidng me to do it, Nina sent this picture which is a really great photoshop work. Thanks, Nina.
