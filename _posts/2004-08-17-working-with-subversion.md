<p>
I'm currently making first steps using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> and it's going quite well. It took some time to get the $Id$ expansion to work though, but <a href="http://wincent.org/article/articleview/236/1/0">this article</a> helped me in the end.
</p>
<p>The next thing I'm going to do is trying to migrate a simple project (no braches, no tags) from CVS to subversion. I know there are some tools out there which promise being able to do that for you, so I hope it'll work.</p>
<p>The final step would be to migrate over <a href="http://www.popscan.ch">PopScan</a>, which has gotten quite complex these days: About 5 branches, countless tags and three years worth of history data. If that too goes well, it's "welcome subversion" for me. If not, I think, I'll postphone the migration until the tools get better. I absolutely don't want to have my code in different source management systems.
</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted.</p>
