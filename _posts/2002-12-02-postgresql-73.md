I've just seen that <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL 7.3</a> has been released. Postgres is an Open Source database which has a surprisingly rich feature-set. Just like the MTA <a href="http://www.exim.org">Exim</a>, PostgreSQL belongs to the group of softweare I *really* like. I 'm looking forward trtying the out the new release...
