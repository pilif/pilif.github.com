<p>You may have noticed that last week had postings on nearly every day - and all the postings seem to have happened around 8:30am.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that I had a lot of inspiration on last Monday, allowing me to write two or three entries at once. I made Serendipity queue them up and post one on each day.</p>
<p>And as time progressed, I was adding more entries which I could schedule to the future too, thus keeping the illusion up that I was actually posting at 8:30 in the morning - a thing I'm certainly not thinking about doing.</p>
<p>While I'm awake at 8:30, I am most certainly not in the mood to post anything not to speak about the lack of inspiration due to not having surfed the web yet.</p>
<p>Writing content ahead of time has some advantages like allowing for better editing (much more time to read before the entry is posted) and it helping keeping the blog alive (a post for every day), but it also has some disadvantages: For one, the entries may not be as deep as one I'm writing for the moment.</p>
<p>After writing down an entry or two, I'm feeling a bit of a burnout, which certainly has negative effects on the entries length and depth.</p>
<p>And even worse: s9y insists on sending pings when the entry is submitted - not when it's published.</p>
<p>This means that I'm sending out pings for non-existing entries (bad thing) or I'm not sending out pings at all (slightly better).</p>
<p>So in retrospect, I'm going to do both: Posting ahead and posting in real-time.</p>
<p>An insider trick to find out if the posting is pre-written or not would be to look at the posting time: If it's 8:30 in the morning, it's prewritten.</p>
